THE <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/supplemental-terms/">SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS</a> AND <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/domain-registration-agreement/">DOMAIN REGISTRATION AGREEMENT</a> (EACH WHERE APPLICABLE), WHICH MAY BE UPDATED BY US FROM TIME TO TIME, ARE HEREBY INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO THE SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT.</p>
<p>THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS PROVISIONS REQUIRING THAT YOU AGREE TO THE USE OF ARBITRATION TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT RATHER THAN A JURY TRIAL OR ANY OTHER COURT PROCEEDINGS, AND TO WAIVE YOUR PARTICIPATION IN CLASS ACTION OF ANY KIND AGAINST CLOUDFLARE.</p>
<p>By clicking on the “Create Account” button (or any similar button) that is presented to you at the time of sign-up, by using or accessing the Services (as defined below), or by otherwise indicating your acceptance of this Agreement, you agree to be bound by this Agreement. Cloudflare may modify this Agreement from time to time, subject to the terms in Section 14 (Changes to this Agreement) below.</p>
<p>If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company, organization, or another legal entity (an “Entity”), you are agreeing to this Agreement for that Entity and representing to Cloudflare that you have the authority to bind such Entity to this Agreement, in which case the terms “you,” “your,” "Customer", or a related capitalized term herein will refer to such Entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with this Agreement, you must not accept this Agreement and must not use the Services (as defined below).</p>
<h2 id="1-overview">1. Overview</h2>
<p>This Agreement governs the use of Cloudflare’s cloud-based solutions that are provided as part of a subscription or require a Cloudflare account, along with any software made available by Cloudflare in connection with such services, including software development kits and Cloudflare’s application programming interfaces (“APIs”) made available in connection with such cloud-based solutions (collectively, the “Services”).</p>

If you are agreeing to this Agreement on behalf of an Entity, such Entity’s Affiliates may also access and use the Services provided that such Affiliates agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, and the Entity remain fully liable for such Affiliates’ actions and omissions in connection with this Agreement as if the Entity had performed such acts and omissions itself. “Affiliate” means any means an entity which, directly or indirectly, owns or controls, is owned or is controlled by or is under common ownership or control with a party, where “control” means the power to direct the management or affairs of an entity, and “ownership” means the beneficial ownership of 50% (or, if the applicable jurisdiction does not allow majority ownership, the maximum amount permitted under such law) or more of the voting equity securities or other equivalent voting interests of the entity.</p>

You acknowledge that by permitting a third party to access your Cloudflare account, the third party may obtain, modify, or delete your account data and settings.</p>
<p>You agree to notify Cloudflare promptly of any actual or suspected unauthorized use of any Credentials. Cloudflare reserves the right to terminate any Credentials that Cloudflare reasonably determines may have been accessed or used by an unauthorized third party and will provide immediate notice of such to you.

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, you hereby grant us a non-exclusive, fully sublicensable, worldwide, royalty-free right to collect, use, copy, store, transmit, modify and create derivative works of Customer Content, in each case to the extent necessary to provide the Services.</p>
<h4 id="252">2.5.2</h4>
<p>You must obtain all necessary rights, releases and permissions to provide Customer Content to Cloudflare, and Customer Content and its transfer must not violate any applicable local, state, federal and international laws and regulations (“Laws”) (including without limitation those relating to export control or electronic communications). Other than our security obligations under Section 6.2 (Security), we assume no responsibility or liability for Customer Content, and you will be solely responsible for the consequences of using, disclosing, storing, transferring or transmitting Customer Content.</p>
<h4 id="253">2.5.3</h4>
<p>Cloudflare may modify certain components of Customer Content on or transmitted to or from your website to enhance your website’s performance or security or the functionality of the Services. For example, depending on the Services you select or the Apps that you enable, Cloudflare may: (i) intercept requests determined to be threats and take actions, such as, presenting them with a challenge page, dropping the request, presenting alternative content, redirecting and other similar measures; (ii) add cookies to your domain to track visitors, such as those who have successfully passed the CAPTCHA on a challenge page; (iii) add scripts to your pages to perform additional performance tracking; (iv) add firewall rules to your website; and (v) make other changes to increase the performance, security or analytic capabilities of your website. Cloudflare will make it clear whenever a feature will materially modify Customer Content and, whenever possible, provide you a mechanism to allow you to disable the feature.</p>
<h4 id="254">2.5.4</h4>
<p>By transmitting Customer Content to or through the Services, you represent and warrant that Customer Content does not infringe, violate, or misappropriate any third-party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right.</p>
<h4 id="255">2.5.5</h4>
<p>Cloudflare retains all right, title, and interest in all models, observations, reports, analyses, statistics, databases and other information created, compiled, analyzed, generated or derived by Cloudflare from server, network or traffic data generated by Cloudflare in the course of providing the Service (“Network Data”), and shall have the right to use Network Data for purposes of providing, maintaining, developing, and improving its Services. Cloudflare may monitor and inspect the traffic on the Cloudflare network, including any related logs, as necessary to perform the Services. To the extent the Network Data includes any Personal Data (as defined below), Cloudflare will handle such Personal Data in compliance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
<h3 id="26-free--trial-services">2.6 Free &amp; Trial Services</h3>
<p>We may offer free or trial versions of the Services (“Free Services”) from time to time. With respect to each such Free Service, we will make each such Free Service available to you free of charge until the earlier of (a) the end of the free trial period (if applicable) for which you registered to use the Free Service; (b) the start date of your Subscription Term for the Paid Services version of such Free Service; or (c) termination of the Free Service by Cloudflare in our sole discretion. We will have no liability for any harm or damage arising out of or in connection with any Free Services.</p>
<h3 id="27-acceptable-use">2.7 Acceptable Use</h3>
<p>By using the Services you are agreeing, among other things, that you will not use the Services to (a) falsely imply any sponsorship or association with Cloudflare; (b) post, transmit, store or link to any files, materials, data, text, audio, video, images or other content that infringe on any person’s intellectual property rights or that are otherwise unlawful; or (c) engage in any activities that are illegal, including disseminating, promoting or facilitating child sexual abuse material or engaging in human trafficking.</p>

If we determine you have breached this Section 2.8, we may immediately suspend or restrict your use of the Services, or limit End User access to certain of your resources through the Services.</p>

We may assign this Agreement at any time without notice. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor will a waiver of any breach or default of this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in this Subscription Agreement is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of particular provisions. In the event that any part of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect. Upon termination of this Agreement, any provision that by its nature or express terms should survive will survive such termination or expiration, including, but not limited to, Sections 2.5.1 and Sections 9 through 19.</p>
<h2 id="17-dispute-resolution-and-arbitration">17. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h2>
<h3 id="171-generally">17.1 Generally</h3>
<p>In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Cloudflare in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Cloudflare agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with this Agreement will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of this Agreement. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND CLOUDFLARE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
<h3 id="172-exceptions">17.2 Exceptions</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding Subsection 17.1, we both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.</p>
<h3 id="173-arbitrator">17.3 Arbitrator</h3>
<p>Any arbitration between you and Cloudflare will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures ("AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at <a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.</p>
<h3 id="174-notice-process">17.4 Notice; Process</h3>
<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice"). Cloudflare's address for Notice is: Cloudflare, Inc., 101 Townsend St., San Francisco, CA 94107. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Cloudflare may commence an arbitration proceeding.</p>
<h3 id="175-fees">17.5 Fees</h3>
<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco, CA provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Cloudflare for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p>
<h3 id="176-no-class-actions">17.6 No Class Actions</h3>
<p>YOU AND CLOUDFLARE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Cloudflare agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>
<h3 id="177-modifications">17.7 Modifications</h3>
<p>In the event that Cloudflare makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Cloudflare's address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Cloudflare's address for Notice, in which case your account with Cloudflare will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject will survive.</p>
<h3 id="178-enforceability">17.8 Enforceability</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding Section 16, if Subsection 17.1 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 17 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 17 will be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 13 will govern any action arising out of or related to this Agreement.</p>
