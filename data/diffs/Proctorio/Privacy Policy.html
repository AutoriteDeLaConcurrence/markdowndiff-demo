<p>Hi there. Welcome to Proctorio's Privacy Policy. Privacy policies can be messy and complicated. But, at Proctorio, your privacy is important to us, which is why we have tried to unscramble the legal jargon to provide one comprehensive spot to provide information to you about our privacy practices.</p>
<h2 id="before-you-dive-in">Before you dive in</h2>
<p>Proctorio would like to start by defining two terms you'll see used throughout Proctorio’s Privacy Policy: data processor and data controller.</p>
<p><strong>Proctorio is a data processor</strong> when Proctorio proctors an exam, verify identities, protect content, or verify originality of an assignment. In these instances, your Institution controls your information, not Proctorio. Please see your Institution's privacy policy and contact them for inquiries regarding your Personal Information.</p>
<p><strong>Proctorio is a data controller</strong> when you have directly input Personal Information into a form on Proctorio’s website, or directly provide Personal Information through Proctorio's customer and/or product services.</p>
<p>Users can utilize Proctorio's Sites or Services without providing Personal Information.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/51c68d59-1161.png" diff:update-attr="src:/assets/images/51c68d59-578.png" alt="A person sitting in front of their laptop, an image of a padlock securing a folder overhead" diff:add-attr="alt"></p>
<p>Proctorio encrypts exam audio, video, and screen recordings and images with Zero-Knowledge Encryption. This means that once these images and recordings are encrypted, they can only be decrypted by Institution-approved representatives.</p>
<p>Proctorio may have access to some of this data (if the Institution chooses to collect it) when providing live technical support to an exam taker during the exam.</p>
<p>With the Live Proctoring Services, Proctorio proctors are able to review exam sessions (including this data, if the Institution chooses to collect it) in real time.</p>
<p>With Professional Review Services, the Institution gives authorized Proctorio staff members temporary access to review exam sessions (including this data, if the Institution chooses to collect it), typically within 48 hours after the exam session.</p>

<h2 id="collecting-personal-information-" diff:rename="h1" class="diff-renamed tooltipped" aria-label="Previous tag : h1">Collecting Personal Information </h2>
<ul>
<li>Proctorio limits the Personal Information collected from end-users through their use of Proctorio’s Services.</li>
<li>Proctorio only collects Personal Information as instructed by your Institution. This is dependent on the Services and settings selected by the relevant Institution-approved representatives.</li>
<li>Proctorio pseudoanonymizes specific test-taker Personal Information.</li>
<li>Audio, video, and screen recordings and images collected and stored by Proctorio are encrypted and can only be decrypted by Institution-approved representatives.</li>
<li>If you voluntarily provide Personal Information through Proctorio’s Sites or Services, Proctorio may retain this Information.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Proctorio’s</strong> <strong>Institution Services:</strong> When an Institution purchases Proctorio’s Service(s), the type of Service and settings selected by the Institution determine what Personal Information an Institution may provide to Proctorio or what Proctorio can collect from the test taker. This is described in more detail below.</p>
<p><strong>Test-taker</strong> <strong>audio, video, and screen recordings and images</strong> <strong>received from Institutions and processed by Proctorio are end-to-end encrypted and can only be decrypted by Institution-approved representatives.</strong></p>
<h2 id="proctoring-">Proctoring </h2>
<p>Only an Institution may request Proctorio to use Automated or Live Proctoring during the administration of an exam.</p>
<p>With either Automated or Live Proctoring, an exam administrator may instruct Proctorio to monitor test takers via a webcam, microphone, browser, and/or desktop in an effort to uphold the integrity of the assessment. This may include a scan of the test taker’s surroundings, screen, and computer display. This monitoring will either be automated and/or conducted by a live proctor. The test taker will be notified, before the beginning of an exam, whether Automated or Live Proctoring is being used.</p>
<h3 id="video-and-audio-recording">Video and audio recording</h3>
<p><strong>Only your Institution maintains and controls the decryption keys necessary to</strong> <strong>decrypt test-taker audio and video recordings and images.</strong></p>
<p>The Institution determines whether audio and/or video is used to monitor and/or record exam sessions and only the exam administrators have access to these audio and/or video recordings. If selected, the entire exam session is recorded.</p>
<p>The Institution also decides whether to record the test taker’s audio during the exam attempt. If selected, the test taker’s microphone is turned on during the session.</p>
<p>Audio, video, and image files are encrypted prior to being transferred to Proctorio's cloud service provider in the location specified by the Institution. The Institution maintains and controls decryption keys, and only the Institution may assign these keys to individuals. The Institution designates these individuals as appropriate.</p>
<p>Depending on the Institution’s location these audio and video files are stored on Proctorio's cloud service provider’s servers in the US, Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia, South Africa, Singapore, or Abu Dhabi. These files never leave the controlling location of the Institution.</p>
<p><strong>Record Screen, Record Web Traffic and Record Room/</strong> <strong>Periodic Desk Scan</strong> are additional options that an exam administrator can select for an exam.</p>
<p><strong>Verify Audio, Video, Desktop and Signature</strong> may also be selected by the exam administrator and the test taker is required to take those actions prior to the start of the exam.</p>
<p>As a result of these Institution-selected monitoring or verification options, Proctorio may collect Personal Information such as a test taker’s image and Personal Information that may be shared through the screen, desktop, webcam, web traffic or microphone of the test taker’s device.</p>
<h3 id="facial-and-gaze-detection-">Facial and gaze detection </h3>
<p>If your Institution elects to use Proctorio's proctoring Services that enable video recording, Proctorio uses facial detection or gaze detection to flag potentially suspicious test activity to help Institution-approved representatives maintain assessment integrity. The Institution may choose to disable facial detection and gaze detection as a secondary setting of the video recording feature if It wishes to opt out of facial detection and gaze detection, but still record the exam session.</p>
<p><strong>P****roctorio does not use what is conventionally known as “biometrics” or “facial recognition” technology.</strong> Facial recognition uniquely identifies specific people by assessing whether the face in one image matches the face in another image. It requires a database of either images of people’s faces, or biometric representations of them, and technology that compares new images or biometric representations with entries in that database.</p>
<p><strong>Instead, Proctorio uses “facial detection” or “gaze detection” technology.</strong> A fundamental difference between these technologies and biometrics or facial recognition technology is that facial or gaze detection technologies do not use geometry or landmarks as identifiers. Additionally this difference, can be illustrated by the questions they answer:</p>
<p><strong>Facial Recognition:</strong> “Does the face in this picture match the face in this other picture?”</p>
<p><strong>Facial Detection:</strong> “Is there a face in this picture?”</p>
<p><strong>Gaze Detection:</strong> “Is the person looking away from the camera or the exam screen?”</p>
<p><strong>Facial detection can identify that there is a human face present in an image or video recording, but it cannot identify that person – only that there is, indeed, a person in the image or recording.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gaze detection can determine the direction that the individual is looking, but cannot identify who they are or what they are looking at.</strong></p>
<p>If the exam administrator enables the use of video recording, Proctorio uses facial detection to flag video evidence that may indicate the number of individuals present within the immediate vicinity of the test taker, but Proctorio does not attempt to determine who those individuals are.</p>
<p>If a test taker is not able to pass the face detection process and enter an exam within three attempts, a Proctorio Support Agent initiates a live chat to troubleshoot the issue. The Support Agent can request access to webcam images from the system, provide instructions that ensure clearly-captured images, and override the system if needed to expedite exam entry.</p>
<p>If the exam administrator enables the use of video recording, Proctorio can use gaze detection to flag video evidence that the individual was looking at something other than the device they were using to take the exam. This helps Institution-approved representatives prioritize where to review exam video recordings to determine if the test taker was consulting unauthorized materials or was receiving outside assistance during the exam attempt. However, the Institution may choose to disable facial detection and gaze detection as a secondary setting of the video recording feature if It wishes to opt out of facial detection and gaze detection, but still record the exam session.</p>
<h3 id="monitoring-during-an-exam">Monitoring during an exam</h3>
<p>When exam administrators select Automated or Live Proctoring Services, Proctorio uses technology to automatically collect certain information about a test taker’s activities during the exam session for purposes of protecting exam integrity. The flagged behaviors may include facial and gaze detection (described above) to monitor if the test taker leaves the session, tracked head movement to monitor how frequently the test taker looks away, sound detection to monitor if other voices are in the room, question response time, dropped internet connections, and other activities that may indicate irregular testing activities. When using these services, Proctorio’s automated technology continually monitors the applications and processes that are running on the device during an exam session and during exam review.</p>
<p>If an Institution has requested reporting, test-taker data may be aggregated, and then individual test-taker data may be compared to the aggregated data to look for patterns or anomalies, such as whether a test taker spent an unusually long time answering a question relative to other users.</p>
<p>Proctorio does not and has not established "normal" profiles or compare test takers against any preserved or aggregated normal.</p>
<p>At the end of an exam session, the Institution-approved representative will have access to a summary report of these flagged activities, as well as the raw data the Service collects from each test-taker’s session. The Institution-approved representative then determines if any further action is warranted. Aggregated data is also provided to the Institution-approved representative (e.g. the average length of time users spent on an exam question, the average time spent on the entire assessment and the average date/time that users started the exam session).</p>
<p>Only an Institution determines whether to enable settings, which settings are enabled for flagging of irregular testing behaviors, and the indication levels (green, yellow, red) assigned to certain activities of the test taker during an exam. Following the Institution-approved representative’s review, only they can determine what, if any, action to take related to a test taker.</p>
<p><strong>Proctorio does not make any decisions related to the test taker from flagged activity.</strong></p>
<h2 id="id-verification">ID Verification</h2>
<p>Additionally, an Institution may select an option to verify the test taker’s identity before they start their exam. The Institution can choose the Live ID Verification or the Automated ID Verification option. In both options, the Personal Information that is collected may include name, government ID number, and date of birth if the test taker chooses to utilize their government-issued ID or the Institution requires the test taker to use the government-issued ID to validate their identity.</p>
<p>This ID image along with other test-taker audio, video, and screen recordings and images are stored with Zero-Knowledge Encryption by Proctorio as described below.</p>
<h3 id="live-id">Live ID</h3>
<p>If this option is selected by the Institution, a photo of the Institution-accepted form of ID will be collected with the webcam and encrypted on Proctorio's servers. The image will be accessible by an Institution-approved representative along with the exam results within the Institution’s assessment platform. Additionally, during the pre-checks a Proctorio proctor will request to see the Institution-accepted form of ID and will record this information. A proctor cannot personally store or use this information other than to verify the test taker’s identity.</p>
<p><strong>The file is transmitted directly from the test taker to the proctor. After the transmission and the identity is verified the file is</strong> <strong>immediately</strong> <strong>deleted</strong>**.**</p>
<h3 id="automated-id">Automated ID</h3>
<p>If this option is selected by the Institution, a photo of the Institution-accepted form of ID will be collected with the webcam and encrypted on Proctorio's servers. The image will only be accessible by an Institution-approved representative along with the exam results within the Institution’s assessment platform.</p>
<h3 id="originality-verification">Originality Verification</h3>
<p>If an Institution selects Proctorio's Originality Verification tool, the test taker may voluntarily submit an assignment that has content or data with Personal Information included.</p>
<h2 id="lock-down-settings">Lock Down Settings</h2>
<p>If these settings are selected by an Institution and enabled on an assessment that uses Proctorio's Services, these features can be used instead of or alongside the monitoring features described above.</p>
<p>Depending on which features are selected by an Institution, the test taker’s device will be locked down so that they cannot access websites, files, or other online or device resources. The test takers will be prevented from downloading materials or entering information that doesn’t relate to the exam only during the exam session. This is done to help ensure test integrity.</p>
<p>When operating as a browser extension, Proctorio only has restricted access to a test taker’s computer system. This includes no access to any personal documents or files stored on the machine.</p>
<p><strong>Users have the ability to disable the Proctorio extension immediately after an exam is submitted.</strong></p>
<p>Although it is not necessary to do so, test takers can uninstall or disable Proctorio immediately after taking an exam, and re-install or enable it only when taking future Proctorio-proctored exams.</p>
<p>Test takers can understand when Proctorio is running, through the exam entering process, when the Proctorio shield icon in the upper-right-hand corner of the browser turns green, and during exam review.</p>
<p>This green icon indicates that the extension is running during the exam.</p>
<p>Lock Down settings include the following, and exam administrators can choose to implement some, all, or none of these during the exam.</p>
<h3 id="lock-down-permissions-and-settings">Lock Down permissions and Settings</h3>
<p>Here are more details on the which Browser Permissions can be required by an Institution and why these Browser Permissions might be required:</p>
<h4 id="read-and-change-data-on-the-websites-you-visit">Read and change data on the websites you visit</h4>
<p>This allows Proctorio to run on each and every website required by your exam administrator or Institution without requiring additional permissions.</p>
<h4 id="display-notifications">Display notifications</h4>
<p>Proctorio may display a pop-up notification while you are in the exam if you navigate away from the exam. This notification states that you are required to return to the exam window.</p>
<h4 id="modify-data-your-copy-and-paste-functionality">Modify data your copy and paste functionality</h4>
<p>The Proctorio platform’s functionality does not include the ability to read or collect the contents in the test taker's clipboard. Instead, during the exam, Proctorio replaces the clipboard text with Proctorio's own content to prevent exam content distribution.</p>
<h4 id="capture-content-from-your-screen">Capture content from your screen</h4>
<p>This recording setting only runs during the exam and exam review. This ensures that test takers are remaining within the exam and showing their work with authorized tools and resources.</p>
<h4 id="manage-your-downloads">Manage your downloads</h4>
<p>Downloads by a test taker will be prevented only during the course of the exam. This ensures that exam content is not shared externally.</p>
<h4 id="identify-storage-devices">Identify storage devices</h4>
<p>Test-taker storage devices are detected and identified during the exam. <strong>Proctorio does not eject storage devices.</strong></p>
<h4 id="manage-your-apps-extensions-and-themes">Manage your apps, extensions, and themes</h4>
<p>Proctorio does not manage the themes of a test taker’s device. But Proctorio does manage extensions and applications that may hinder Proctorio from operating properly.</p>
<h4 id="change-your-privacy-related-settings">Change your privacy-related settings</h4>
<p>Proctorio uses this to temporarily block the test taker’s browser "password" fill option during the course of the exam.</p>
<h2 id="zero-knowledge-encryption">Zero-Knowledge Encryption</h2>
<p>When processing and securing test-taker Information from an Institution, Proctorio does not mess around. That’s why Proctorio utilizes an end to end encryption method called “<strong>Zero-Knowledge</strong> <strong>Encryption</strong>”.</p>
<p><strong>“Zero-Knowledge Encryption” means that only Institution-approved representatives at Institutions can decrypt and review the encrypted exam recordings on Proctorio’s servers.</strong></p>
<p>Only the Institution has the “key” that is needed to access Personal Information that they’ve provided to their test takers or test-taker Personal Information that has been provided to Proctorio. Proctorio utilizes PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 to generate the keys. Then AES-256 GCM encryption is used to encrypt the files and finally Proctorio uses TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 with perfect forward secrecy to transfer any and all data. </p>
<p>Proctorio uses Zero-Knowledge Encryption for any audio, video, and screen recordings and images sent by a test taker. This means only Institution-approved representatives can decrypt, watch, and review the encrypted Information.</p>
<h2 id="test-taker-records">Test-taker records</h2>
<p>All test-taker records that are “student” or “educational records” obtained by Proctorio from an educational Institution are the property of the Institution and are under the control of that Institution. Institutions or the respective test taker owns the data.</p>
<p>Proctorio will follow the instructions provided by the Institution and make every effort to comply with applicable law. In these instances, Proctorio is a processor for the educational Institution and the educational Institution is the controller. Their Privacy Policy controls the use of test-taker Information.</p>
<p><strong>If you are looking for information regarding your test-taker records please reach out to your Institution.</strong></p>
<h2 id="information-collected-from-institution-approved-representatives-">Information collected from Institution-approved representatives </h2>

<h2 id="as-a-data-processor-1">As a data processor</h2>
<p>Data that enters Proctorio's system has been encrypted using an unshared key stored in an Institution’s assessment platform and can only be unlocked by the Institution-approved representative within the assessment platform. Proctorio utilizes the assessment platform to gain information about the user's role. This restricts information from being shared with users who are not labeled as an Institution-approved representative. The entire process is transparent to the end user.</p>
<h2 id="as-a-data-controller-1">As a data controller</h2>
<p>In instances where Proctorio is the controller and Proctorio collects test-taker Personal Information, such as when a test taker contacts Proctorio's Customer Service or requests Service information, information about Proctorio's company, or other inquiries, Proctorio may disclose your Personal Information in the following <strong>limited</strong> circumstances:</p>
<h3 id="law-and-harm">Law and harm</h3>
<p>Proctorio may disclose test-taker Information if Proctorio believes that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security, or technical issues; or to protect Proctorio's rights or property.</p>
<h3 id="business-transfers">Business transfers</h3>
<p>Test-taker Personal Information maintained in the Institution’s exam platform is the property of the Institution. Test-taker audio, video, and screen recordings and images stored within the Proctorio servers are pseudoanonymized and encrypted and will not be sold or transferred to a third party if Proctorio is involved in an acquisition, merger or other corporate reorganization transaction. In such instances, and consistent with and limited to data protection laws and privacy commitments, marketing analytics data, CRM data, customer lists, and other pseudoanonymized data may be disclosed or transferred as part of a corporate reorganization transaction; provided that the acquirer commits to using the information in a manner consistent with applicable law and this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Proctorio does not and will not sell or otherwise transfer your data to any third party except as specifically stated in Proctorio’s Terms.</p>
<h3 id="identify-verification">Identify verification</h3>
<p>Proctorio may use third parties for identity verification with individual consent to successfully enter or submit a proctored exam using Proctorio's Services.</p>
<h3 id="payment-processing">Payment processing</h3>
<p>Proctorio uses a third-party payment processor to process payments. Proctorio does not directly collect payment information and is not a money-services business. To the extent such functionality is made available in the Services, it is provided by an unaffiliated third party, and like any other third-party service, is subject to their terms of use.</p>
<h3 id="third-party-service-providers">Third-party service providers</h3>
<p>Proctorio uses third-party service providers to help provide Proctorio's Services, such as hosting Proctorio's various blogs, Help Center, and knowledge bases, and to help Proctorio understand the use of Proctorio's Services. As Proctorio uses Zero-Knowledge Encryption for audio, video, and screen recordings and images, it is encrypted and not accessible by the third-party service provider. In all instances, third-party services providers can only use any data for Proctorio's business purposes as specified in Proctorio's written agreement with them and not their own purposes. These Services may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP request.</p>

<h3 id="other-disclosures">Other disclosures</h3>
<p>Proctorio may disclose test-taker Information to fulfill the purpose for which you provide it and to enforce or apply agreements with Proctorio.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-student-education-records-and-ferpa">What about student education records and FERPA?</h2>
<p>Proctorio adheres to the <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html">Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)</a> as applicable when it is providing Services to educational Institutions in the United States that are subject to FERPA.</p>
<p>Proctorio works with Institution(s) to ensure compliance with FERPA and applicable privacy laws. One of the most important ways in which we strive to adhere to FERPA and restrict disclosure is to encrypt test-taker audio, video, and screen recordings and images. As described in this Privacy Policy, <a href="#section-zeroknowledgeencryption">Proctorio uses Zero-Knowledge Encryption</a> to do this when an Institution has an agreement to utilize Proctorio's Services.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-ferpa">What is FERPA?</h3>
<p>FERPA is a federal law that affords students (or parents/guardians for students under 18 or not enrolled in a post-secondary Institution) certain rights with respect to their education records.</p>
<p>In the United States, Proctorio has agreements with educational Institutions that are subject to FERPA and Proctorio acts as a third-party service provider of such educational Institutions and must make every effort to comply with FERPA generally as a “School Official.” This means Proctorio is providing Proctorio's Services on behalf of the educational Institution and only as authorized by them for legitimate educational purposes.</p>
<h4 id="why-is-ferpa-important">Why is FERPA important?</h4>
<p>FERPA protects students from having their information disclosed to third parties without the eligible student (18+) or parent’s/guardian’s consent unless there is an applicable exception under FERPA, such as when a third-party service provider is authorized by an educational Institution by a written agreement to provide services as a “School Official.”</p>
<p>Proctorio complies with FERPA by only using student Personal Information as a School Official as authorized by an educational Institution in Proctorio's written agreements.</p>
<p>Proctorio <a href="https://ikeepsafe.org/products/">certified as FERPA compliant by the iKeep Safe Coalition</a> which signifies Proctorio's compliance with relevant laws and regulations. Proctorio is also a <a href="https://studentprivacypledge.org/signatories/">signatory of the Student Privacy</a> <a href="https://studentprivacypledge.org/signatories/">Pledge</a>, where Proctorio pledges responsible stewardship and appropriate use of student Personal Information according to the commitments in the Pledge and in an effort to adhere to all laws applicable to Proctorio as a school service provider.</p>
<p>Remember audio, video, and screen recordings and images collected during the exam attempt, stored by Proctorio, and received from an Institution are encrypted using Zero-Knowledge Encryption. These recordings and images can only be decrypted and reviewed by Institution-approved representatives within the Institution’s assessment platform. Proctorio dictates who these authorized users are by utilizing the educational Institution’s assessment platform to gain information about the user's role. This restricts information from being shared with users who do not fall under the "School Official" role. The entire process is transparent to the end user. Proctorio securely delivers all content for the Services encrypted and Proctorio's servers make every effort to comply with industry security standards, including ISO 27001 and PCI-DSS.</p>
<p>For Proctorio's technical support channels, Proctorio's Support Representatives are trained on privacy and security and are instructed not to ask for information beyond what FERPA defines as "Directory Information”. This information may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Student full name</li>
<li>Campus email address</li>
<li>Institution name</li>
</ul>
<p>To better ensure FERPA and privacy and security compliance, Proctorio's employees receive periodic privacy and security training. Proctorio has been ISO 27001 certified.</p>

In these instances, the Institution (on behalf of the parent) provides the required consent for Proctorio to collect Personal Information of a child under 18 for this purpose as a “School Official.” Under FERPA, Institutions in the United States subject to this law must provide an annual notice to parents of third parties that are providing services under the FERPA “School Official” exception.</p>
<p>Other than as described above, Proctorio's Site and Services are not directed to children.</p>

<h3 id="when-proctorio-is-a-data-controller">When Proctorio is a data controller</h3>

Where legitimate interest is Proctorio's lawful basis for processing, Proctorio has conducted an assessment to balance the individual’s privacy rights against Proctorio's legitimate need to process the Personal Information. In some cases, Proctorio may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Information from you.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="security-">Security </h2>
<p>Proctorio employs procedural and technical security measures that are reasonably designed to help protect Proctorio's test takers’ Personal Information from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, which includes encryption and other security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to a test taker’s Personal Information. The data a test taker transmits as part of their use of the Institution Services ("Storage Data") is encrypted and Proctorio does not have the decryption keys to decrypt or review test-taker Storage Data in its unencrypted form.</p>
<p>Proctorio is committed to maintaining the security and confidentiality of test-taker Information.</p>
<p>Towards this end, Proctorio takes the following actions:</p>
<p>(a) Proctorio limits employee access to test-taker information to only those employees and contractors who need the information to fulfill their job responsibilities;</p>
<p>(b) Proctorio conducts regular employee privacy and data security training and education; and</p>
<p>(c) Proctorio protects your Information with technical, contractual, administrative, and physical security safeguards in order to protect against unauthorized access, release, or use.</p>
<p>Proctorio is SOC 2 and ISO 27001 certified and conducts regular security audits including penetration testing and vulnerability assessments. Institutions or their designated representatives may review security testing results, subject to confidentiality requirements, or conduct their own security audit of Proctorio’s data security and storage practices, subject to mutual agreement. Written requests for inspection and testing can be made to <a href="https://proctorio.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#removed">[email protected]</a>.</p>
<p>Test-taker audio, video, and screen recordings and images are secured and processed through three layers of encryption:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Zero-Knowledge Encryption layer is used when information is stored and is secured using AES-GCM.</li>
<li>Transmission into the datacenter is over TLSv1.2 / TLSv1.3 and, if the client supports it, Proctorio uses Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).</li>
<li>All data centers are ISO 270001 certified, SOC 2 attested.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="security-systems-breach-notification-">Security systems breach notification </h3>
<h4 id="as-a-data-processor-3">As a data processor</h4>
<p><strong>Proctorio</strong> <strong>will notify the Institution. The Institution is responsible for notifying its test takers.</strong></p>
<h4 id="as-a-data-controller-2">As a data controller</h4>
<p>If Proctorio learns of a security systems breach, Proctorio may attempt to notify you electronically. Proctorio may post a notice on Proctorio's Sites and/or Services if a security breach occurs. Proctorio may also send an email at the email address provided. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.</p>
<h2 id="live-proctors-">Live proctors </h2>
<p>Live proctors are used for Live Proctoring and Live ID Verification Services only when selected by an Institution.</p>
<p>All Proctorio proctors sign a confidentiality agreement restricting them from using and disclosing any of the test taker’s Personal Information for any purpose other than providing the testing services.</p>
<p>All proctors are full-time Proctorio employees and are required to go through an extensive background check and fingerprinting process. All Proctorio proctors can view, note, and record exam attempts. Proctorio proctors go through a five-week training process with Proctorio's Proctorio Training Specialists and must complete Privacy &amp; Security Training. The proctors are the only employees who have access to the tools required for Live Proctoring and only company-owned and controlled devices can access this information. This is further restricted using IP address restrictions to ensure these devices are being accessed in appropriate locations. Proctorio proctors are then uniquely identified at sign-on by using two-factor authentication and the device is restricted based on the user's group, department, and access level. Device compliance testing is run regularly and devices out of compliance are blocked from accessing any restricted resources until compliance is restored.</p>
<h2 id="data-storage-" diff:rename="h1" class="diff-renamed tooltipped" aria-label="Previous tag : h1">Data storage </h2>
<ul>
<li>Proctorio stores test-taker Personal Information, including all audio, video, and screen recordings and images, which Proctorio collects during the exam for the minimum amount of time required by the Institution or by applicable law.</li>
