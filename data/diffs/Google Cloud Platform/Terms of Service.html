<h1 id="google-cloud-platform-terms-of-service">Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service</h1>
<p>If you are accessing the Google Cloud Platform Services as a customer of an unaffiliated Google Cloud Platform reseller, the terms below do not apply to you, and your agreement with your reseller governs your use of the Google Cloud Platform Services.</p>
<p>If you signed an offline variant of this Agreement for use of the Google Cloud Platform services under the same Google Cloud Platform Account, the terms below do not apply to you, and your offline terms govern your use of the Google Cloud Platform Services.</p>
<p>If your billing account is in India, please review these <a href="https://cloud.google.com/terms/india">Terms of Service</a>, which apply to your use of Google Cloud Platform.</p>
<p>If your billing account is in Brazil, please review these <a href="https://cloud.google.com/terms/?hl=pt-br">Terms of Service</a>, which apply to your use of Google Cloud Platform.</p>
<p>Se a sua conta para faturamento é no Brasil, por gentileza veja o <a href="https://cloud.google.com/terms/?hl=pt-br">Termos de Serviço</a>, que será o Termo aplicável à sua utilização da Google Cloud Platform.</p>
<p>These Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service (together, the "Agreement") are entered into by Google and the entity or person agreeing to these terms ("Customer") and govern Customer's access to and use of the Services. "Google" has the meaning given at <a href="https://cloud.google.com/terms/google-entity">https://cloud.google.com/terms/google-entity</a>.</p>
<p>This Agreement is effective when Customer clicks to accept it (the "Effective Date"). If you are accepting on behalf of Customer, you represent and warrant that (i) you have full legal authority to bind Customer to this Agreement; (ii) you have read and understand this Agreement; and (iii) you agree, on behalf of Customer, to this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>1. Provision of the Services.</strong></p>
<p>1.1 <em>Services Use.</em> During the Term, Google will provide the Services in accordance with the Agreement, including the SLAs, and Customer may use the Services, and integrate the Services into any Customer Application that has material value independent of the Services, in accordance with the Agreement.</p>
<p>1.2 <em>Admin Console.</em> Customer will have access to the Admin Console, through which Customer may manage its use of the Services.</p>
<p>1.3 <em>Accounts.</em> Customer must have an Account to use the Services and is responsible for the information it provides to create the Account, the security of its passwords for the Account, and for any use of its Account. Google has no obligation to provide multiple accounts to Customer.</p>
<p>1.4 <em>Modifications.</em></p>
<p>(a) <em>To the Services.</em> Google may make commercially reasonable updates to the Services from time to time. Google will inform Customer if Google makes a material change to the Services that has a material impact on Customer's use of the Services provided that Customer has subscribed with Google to be informed about such change.</p>
<p>(b) <em>To the Agreement.</em> Google may make changes to this Agreement (including the URL Terms) and pricing from time to time. Unless otherwise noted by Google, material changes to the Agreement will become effective 30 days after they are posted, except to the extent the changes apply to new functionality or the Data Processing and Security Terms, or are required by applicable law, in which case they will be effective immediately. Google will provide at least 90 days' advance notice for materially adverse changes to any SLAs by (i) sending an email to the Notification Email Address; (ii) posting a notice in the Admin Console; or (iii) posting a notice to the applicable SLA webpage. If Customer does not agree to the revised Agreement, Customer may stop using the Services. Customer may also terminate this Agreement for convenience under Section 8.4 (Termination for Convenience). Customer's continued use of the Services after such material change will constitute Customer's consent to such changes. Google will post any modification to this Agreement to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/terms/">https://cloud.google.com/terms/</a>.</p>
<p>(c) <em>To the Data Processing and Security Terms.</em> Google may only change the Data Processing and Security Terms where such change is required to comply with applicable law, is expressly permitted by the Data Processing and Security Terms, or:</p>
<p>(i) is commercially reasonable;</p>
<p>(ii) does not result in a material reduction of the security of the Services;</p>
<p>(iii) does not expand the scope of or remove any restrictions on Google's processing of "Customer Personal Data," as described in the "Scope of Processing" Section of the Data Processing and Security Terms; and</p>
<p>(iv) does not otherwise have a material adverse impact on Customer's rights under the Data Processing and Security Terms.</p>
<p>If Google makes a material change to the Data Processing and Security Terms in accordance with this Section 1.4(c) (Modifications: To the Data Processing and Security Terms), Google will post the change at the webpage containing the Data Processing and Security Terms.</p>
<p>(d) <em>Discontinuation of Services.</em> Google will notify Customer at least 12 months before discontinuing any Service (or associated material functionality) unless Google replaces such discontinued Service or functionality with a materially similar Service or functionality. Further, Google will notify Customer at least 12 months before significantly modifying a Customer-facing Google API in a backwards-incompatible manner. Nothing in this Section 1.4(d) (Discontinuation of Services) limits Google's ability to make changes required to comply with applicable law, address a material security risk, or avoid a substantial economic or material technical burden. This Section 1.4(d) (Discontinuation of Services) does not apply to pre-general availability Services, offerings, or functionality.</p>
<p>1.5 <em>Software.</em> Google may make Software available to Customer, including third-party software. Customer's use of any Software is subject to the applicable provisions in the Service Specific Terms.</p>
<p><strong>2. Payment Terms.</strong></p>
<p>2.1 <em>Online Billing.</em> At the end of the applicable Fee Accrual Period or as otherwise stated by Google in the Admin Console, Google will issue an electronic bill to Customer for all charges based on Customer's use of the Services during the applicable Fee Accrual Period (including, if applicable, the relevant Fees for TSS). Customer will pay all Fees in the currency stated in the invoice. If Customer elects to pay by credit card, debit card, or other non-invoiced form of payment, Google will charge (and Customer will pay) all Fees immediately at the end of the Fee Accrual Period. If Customer elects to pay by invoice (and Google agrees), all Fees are due as stated in the invoice. Customer's obligation to pay all Fees is non-cancellable. Google's measurement of Customer's use of the Services is final. Google has no obligation to provide multiple bills. Payments made via wire transfer must include the bank information provided by Google.</p>
<p>2.2 <em>Taxes.</em></p>
<p>(a) Customer is responsible for any Taxes, and will pay Google for the Services without any reduction for Taxes. If Google is obligated to collect or pay any Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to Customer and Customer will pay such Taxes to Google, unless Customer provides Google with a timely and valid tax exemption certificate in respect of those Taxes.</p>
<p>(b) Customer will provide Google with any applicable tax identification information that Google may require under applicable law to ensure its compliance with applicable tax regulations and authorities in applicable jurisdictions. Customer will be liable to pay (or reimburse Google for) any taxes, interest, penalties, or fines arising out of any mis-declaration by Customer.</p>
<p>2.3 <em>Payment Disputes &amp; Refunds.</em> Any payment disputes must be submitted before the payment due date. If the parties determine that certain billing inaccuracies are attributable to Google, Google will not issue a corrected invoice, but will instead issue a credit memo specifying the incorrect amount in the affected invoice. If a disputed invoice has not yet been paid, Google will apply the credit memo amount to a disputed invoice and Customer will be responsible for paying the resulting net balance due on that invoice. Refunds (if any) are at Google's discretion and will only be in the form of credit for the Services. Nothing in this Agreement obligates Google to extend credit to any party.</p>
<p>2.4 <em>Delinquent Payments; Suspension.</em> Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) from the payment due date until paid in full. Customer will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by Google in collecting such delinquent amounts. Further, if Customer's payment for the Services is overdue, Google may Suspend the Services.</p>
<p>2.5 <em>No Purchase Order Number Required.</em> Customer is obligated to pay all applicable Fees without any requirement for Google to provide a purchase order number on Google's invoice (or otherwise).</p>
<p><strong>3. Customer Obligations.</strong></p>
<p>3.1 <em>Compliance.</em> Customer will (a) ensure that Customer and its End Users' use of the Services complies with the Agreement, (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent and terminate any unauthorized use of, or access to, the Services, and (c) promptly notify Google of any unauthorized use of, or access to, the Services, Account, or Customer's password of which Customer becomes aware. Google reserves the right to investigate any potential violation of the AUP by Customer, which may include reviewing Customer Applications, Customer Data, or Projects.</p>
<p>3.2 <em>Privacy</em>. Customer is responsible for any consents and notices required to permit (a) Customer's use and receipt of the Services and (b) Google's accessing, storing, and processing of data provided by Customer (including Customer Data, if applicable) under the Agreement.</p>
<p>3.3 <em>Restrictions.</em> Customer will not, and will not allow End Users to, (a) copy, modify, or create a derivative work of the Services; (b) reverse engineer, decompile, translate, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to extract any or all of the source code of, the Services (except to the extent such restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law); (c) sell, resell, sublicense, transfer, or distribute any or all of the Services; or (d) access or use the Services (i) for High Risk Activities; (ii) in violation of the AUP; (iii) in a manner intended to avoid incurring Fees (including creating multiple Customer Applications, Accounts, or Projects to simulate or act as a single Customer Application, Account, or Project (respectively)) or to circumvent Service-specific usage limits or quotas; (iv) to engage in cryptocurrency mining without Google's prior written approval; (v) to operate or enable any telecommunications service or in connection with any Customer Application that allows End Users to place calls or to receive calls from any public switched telephone network, unless otherwise described in the Service Specific Terms; (vi) for materials or activities that are subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) maintained by the United States Department of State; (vii) in a manner that breaches, or causes the breach of, Export Control Laws; or (viii) to transmit, store, or process health information subject to United States HIPAA regulations except as permitted by an executed HIPAA BAA.</p>
<p>3.4 <em>Documentation.</em> Google may provide Documentation for Customer's use of the Services.</p>
<p>3.5 <em>Copyright.</em> Google provides information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online, but Google cannot determine whether something is being used legally without input from the copyright holders. Google will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and may terminate repeat infringers in appropriate circumstances as required to maintain safe harbor for online service providers under the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If Customer believes a person or entity is infringing Customer's or its End User's copyrights and would like to notify Google, Customer can find information about submitting notices, and Google's policy about responding to notices, at <a href="https://www.google.com/dmca.html">https://www.google.com/dmca.html</a>.</p>
<p><strong>4. Suspension.</strong></p>
<p>4.1 <em>AUP Violations.</em> If Google becomes aware that Customer's or any End User's use of the Services violates the AUP, Google will notify Customer and request that Customer correct the violation. If Customer fails to correct the violation within 24 hours of Google's request, then Google may Suspend all or part of Customer's use of the Services until the violation is corrected.</p>
<p>4.2 <em>Other Suspension.</em> Notwithstanding Section 4.1 (AUP Violations), Google may immediately Suspend all or part of Customer's use of the Services if (a) Google reasonably believes Customer's or any End User's use of the Services could adversely impact the Services, other customers' or their end users' use of the Services, or the Google network or servers used to provide the Services; (b) there is suspected unauthorized third-party access to the Services; (c) Google reasonably believes that immediate Suspension is required to comply with any applicable law; or (d) Customer is in breach of Section 3.3 (Restrictions) or the Service Specific Terms. Google will lift any such Suspension when the circumstances giving rise to the Suspension have been resolved. At Customer's request, Google will, unless prohibited by applicable law, notify Customer of the basis for the Suspension as soon as is reasonably possible.</p>
<p><strong>5. Intellectual Property Rights; Protection of Customer Data; Feedback.</strong></p>
<p>5.1 <em>Intellectual Property Rights.</em> Except as expressly stated in this Agreement, this Agreement does not grant either party any rights, implied or otherwise, to the other's content or any of the other's intellectual property. As between the parties, Customer owns all Intellectual Property Rights in Customer Data and Customer Applications, and Google owns all Intellectual Property Rights in the Services and Software.</p>
<p>5.2 <em>Protection of Customer Data.</em> Google will only access or use Customer Data to provide the Services and TSS to Customer or as otherwise instructed by Customer and will not use it for any other Google products, services, or advertising. Google has implemented and will maintain administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect Customer Data, as further described in the Data Processing and Security Terms.</p>
<p>5.3 <em>Customer Feedback</em>. At its option, Customer may provide feedback or suggestions about the Services to Google ("Feedback"). If Customer provides Feedback, then Google and its Affiliates may use that Feedback without restriction and without obligation to Customer.</p>
<p><strong>6. Technical Support Services.</strong></p>
<p>6.1 <em>By Customer.</em> Customer is responsible for technical support of its Customer Applications and Projects.</p>
<p>6.2 <em>By Google.</em> Subject to payment of applicable support Fees, Google will provide TSS to Customer during the Term in accordance with the TSS Guidelines. Certain TSS levels include a minimum recurring Fee as described at <a href="https://cloud.google.com/skus">https://cloud.google.com/skus</a>. If Customer downgrades its TSS level during any calendar month, Google may continue to provide TSS at the same level and for the same TSS Fees as applied before the downgrade for the remainder of that month.</p>
<p><strong>7. Confidential Information.</strong></p>
<p>7.1 <em>Obligations.</em> The recipient will only use the disclosing party's Confidential Information to exercise the recipient's rights and fulfill its obligations under the Agreement, and will use reasonable care to protect against the disclosure of the disclosing party's Confidential Information. The recipient may disclose Confidential Information only to its Affiliates, employees, agents, or professional advisors ("Delegates") who need to know it and who have agreed in writing (or in the case of professional advisors are otherwise bound) to keep it confidential. The recipient will ensure that its Delegates use the received Confidential Information only to exercise rights and fulfill obligations under this Agreement.</p>
<p>7.2 Required Disclosure. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, the recipient or its Affiliate may also disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by applicable Legal Process; provided that the recipient or its Affiliate uses commercially reasonable efforts to (a) promptly notify the other party before any such disclosure of its Confidential Information, and (b) comply with the other party's reasonable requests regarding its efforts to oppose the disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subsections (a) and (b) above will not apply if the recipient determines that complying with (a) and (b) could (i) result in a violation of Legal Process; (ii) obstruct a governmental investigation; or (iii) lead to death or serious physical harm to an individual.</p>
<p><strong>8. Term and Termination.</strong></p>
<p>8.1 <em>Agreement Term.</em> The term of this Agreement (the "Term") will begin on the Effective Date and continue until the Agreement is terminated as stated in this Section 8 (Term and Termination).</p>
<p>8.2 <em>Termination for Breach.</em> To the extent permitted by applicable law, either party may terminate this Agreement immediately on written notice if (a) the other party is in material breach of the Agreement and fails to cure that breach within 30 days after receipt of written notice of the breach or (b) the other party ceases its business operations or becomes subject to insolvency proceedings and the proceedings are not dismissed within 90 days.</p>

<p>(a) Any indemnified party must promptly notify the indemnifying party in writing of any allegation(s) that preceded the Third-Party Legal Proceeding and cooperate reasonably with the indemnifying party to resolve the allegation(s) and Third-Party Legal Proceeding.

<p>(b) If Google does not believe the remedies in Section 13.5(a) are commercially reasonable, then Google may Suspend or terminate Customer's use of the impacted Services.</p>
<p>13.6 <em>Sole Rights and Obligations.</em> Without affecting either party's termination rights, this Section 13 (Indemnification) states the parties' sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement for any third-party allegations of Intellectual Property Rights infringement covered by this Section 13 (Indemnification).</p>
