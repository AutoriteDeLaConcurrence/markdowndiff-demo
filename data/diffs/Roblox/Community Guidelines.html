<p>At Roblox, we’re building the metaverse: a space for people to adventure, experience, and explore. We’re a global community on this journey together, and we want to ensure everyone feels welcome and safe and is treated with kindness and respect. That’s why we’ve created these Community Standards: to outline how we expect our users to behave, and to be clear up front about what is and isn’t allowed on Roblox.</p>
<p>Our Community Standards are organized into four sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Safety</li>
<li>Civility &amp; Respect</li>
<li>Fairness &amp; Transparency</li>
<li>Security &amp; Privacy</li>
</ul>
<p>These standards apply to all of your actions on Roblox and with other Robloxians, both online and at real-world events hosted by Roblox. You might notice that some of these rules prohibit things that certain other online platforms allow. That’s because of our determination to keep Roblox as safe as possible. We ask that you respect our standards — and understand that violating them may result in enforcement action against your account. We’re always learning, so as our community evolves and our platform grows, these standards may change too.</p>
<p>In short, when using Roblox, always remember to <strong>be kind</strong>. If you see something that you think violates the Community Standards, please let us know by using the <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203312410">Report Abuse</a> feature. For more information about the legal relationship between you and Roblox, head over to our <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004647846">Terms of Use</a>.</p>
<p>We appreciate your cooperation with these standards and commitment to making Roblox a safe and respectful space.</p>

<strong>Advertising</strong><br>
You can place ads in your experience in the form of 3d assets, static images, or videos, as long as you directly upload the ad assets (‘direct upload ads’) and follow the rules outlined below. Roblox will determine, at its sole discretion, whether advertising or brand placement meets these requirements and we may reject ads whose content harms our relationship with our community or compromises our competitive interests (e.g., gaming platforms and development tools). If your ad violates these rules, we may remove the content or suspend your experience, or require you to remove the content, at any time and without notice. * Developers who place advertisements in their experiences remain responsible for all advertising content; ads must follow the Community Rules, the Terms of Use and all other Roblox rules. * You may not relinquish control of the ad serving logic in your experience, including by using third party ad servers. * Ads may not contain content intended for users under the age of 13. * Ads must comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), Children’s Advertising Review Unit (“CARU”) and Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative (“CFBAI”) guidelines, and all other applicable local laws and regulations. * Ads cannot falsely represent the content being advertised to encourage user engagement (e.g., offer free Robux). * Developers may only share aggregated user information with third party advertisers.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="security-and-privacy"><strong>SECURITY AND PRIVACY</strong></h2>
<p>For our metaverse to thrive, the Roblox community must feel digitally safe as well as physically safe.
