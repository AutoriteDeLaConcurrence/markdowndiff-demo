<p diff:insert="" diff:move="" diff:rename="li" class="diff-moved diff-renamed tooltipped diff-inserted" aria-label="Previous tag : li">Your data and booking history are stored in your customer account so you can make use of the many options that it affords, depending on the touchpoint in question. </p>

</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Managing master data</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You can save your name and address so you can then access them when making bookings at a later date as a registered customer. If necessary, you can include different delivery and invoicing addresses. </p>
<p>Furthermore, you can save your preferred payment details for use when making subsequent bookings. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Making and managing bookings</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Our system automatically uses the data in your customer account (incl. payment details) during bookings, but you still have the opportunity to change this information before concluding the booking. In addition, registered customers can make a booking for someone else. You also have access to an overview of your future and past bookings, which makes it possible for you to manage them quickly and easily. You can create travel notifications for future bookings and add extra options such as seat reservations after completing the initial booking. In addition, you can cancel a booking and apply for a refund in line with the ticket's conditions of sale. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong> Booking services: save frequently used<delete> connections, routes and booking profiles</delete><insert> connections</insert> </strong></li>
</ul>
<p diff:delete="" class="diff-deleted">A range of booking services are available for your use. </p>
<p>"My next connections" lets you create, edit and delete connections that you often use.</p>
<p diff:delete="" class="diff-deleted">"My routes" lets you save, edit and delete multiple routes. If you want to search for travel information on a connection, you can then select one of the routes you've saved. </p>
<p diff:delete="" class="diff-deleted">"My booking profiles" lets you save, edit and delete frequently used information in your bookings in the form of a profile. If you use one of your profiles when making a booking, you do not have to reselect the settings it contains but can, if you want, change them before concluding the booking. You can save information on travellers and reservation preferences in different profiles. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Travel notifications</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You can create notifications for your journey and deactivate them again at any time. You can specify connections for which you want to receive automatic notification if a train is delayed or cancelled, or if a particular station or stop will not be served. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BahnCard</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Your customer account provides you with an overview of all your BahnCards, which includes main cards and partner cards. Each card's validity period is displayed. You can cancel your BahnCard contract or exchange your current card for a different one, in line with the conditions of sale. Ordering a new BahnCard is simpler for you, as our system uses the data in your customer account when you place the order. </p>
<p>If you have a BahnCard 100 for travel in first class, your customer account provides you with an overview of your allowance of free seat reservations. It displays how many free seat reservations remain, and you can also use your customer account to make a seat reservation. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BahnBonus</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You can register for the BahnBonus programme via your customer account. Once you register, you can opt to automatically collect bonus and status points every time you book a ticket via your customer account. If you do not select this option, our system will ask you if you want to collect points every time you make a booking. </p>
<p>Your customer account shows an overview of the bonus and status points you have collected, in addition to the points you have redeemed. This enables you to keep track of your points and see how many you have received for a specific booking or how many have been deducted for a specific bonus. </p>
<p>You also receive information regarding our status programme for frequent travellers and you can, for instance, see how many status points you have collected. </p>
<p>You have the option of redeeming BahnBonus points items in our BahnBonus rewards catalogue. If you no longer want to participate in the BahnBonus programme, you can use your customer account to unregister from it. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DB subscriptions and commuter tickets</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Your customer account provides you with an overview of your DB subscriptions and DB commuter tickets. It displays each contract's area of validity and validity period. You can cancel a contract or exchange one you currently have for a different one, in line with the conditions of sale. Concluding a new contract is simpler for you, as our system uses the data in your customer account when you place the order. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Managing advertising and contact preferences</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You can use your customer account to consent to receiving newsletters from DB Vertrieb GmbH or to withdraw consent given in the past. </p>
<p>You can also consent to receiving DB Fernverkehr AG's marketing e-mails or withdraw consent given in the past. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complaints, criticism, praise or suggestions</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Your customer account makes it easier for you to send the DB companies complaints, criticism, praise or suggestions regarding a future or previous booking. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Submitting compensation forms (passenger rights)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As a registered customer, submitting a form for compensation in connection with a passenger rights claim (due to a delayed or cancelled train) is easier for you.  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Offers, vouchers and information</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You can receive notification about the DB companies' offers, vouchers and information by post, via the companies' websites and apps and, if you wish, by e-mail. </p>
<p>For example, we will alert you to situations that have a negative impact on services so that you can take them into consideration before and while you travel. </p>
<p>As someone with a customer account, you can receive offers or vouchers for future journeys and for BahnCards when you visit a DB Travel Centre. Simply tell the staff member you are talking to that you have a customer account.  </p>
<p>We also use the e-mail address you provide during registration or due to contractual commitments (e.g. booking a digital ticket) to inform you electronically (via e-mail and push notifications in particular) about similar products or services we offer. You can revoke your consent to the future commercial processing of your data whenever you wish. You can submit your objection via the objection link in any e-mail received for this purpose or by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:ecommerce-datenschutz@bahn.de">ecommerce-datenschutz@bahn.de</a> (Advertising Objection).</p>
<p>Our goal is to continuously upgrade and improve your customer account. We therefore reserve the right to expand, restrict or otherwise modify the customer account's functions by a reasonable degree at any given time.  </p>
