<p><strong>Section 3: Collection of personal data when renting a Vehicle or becoming a member</strong></p>

<li>If you like to rent a bike, ebike, etc. (“Vehicle”) or becoming a member, you will need to provide personal data (e.g. name, email address, mobile number, payment method, credit card number etc.) in order to conclude the contract. In addition, we need this personal information in order to process your order. The legal basis for this is Article 6 (1) (1) point (b) of the GDPR. We store these data as long as you are our customer with an active account. Your account is regarded inactive, if you have not made use of the account for 36 consecutive months, after which point in time the order data will be erased, if we are not obliged to retain the data as described below.</li>
<li>Under the provisions of the applicable commercial and tax laws, we are obliged to retain your order data for the legally prescribed period. The legal basis for this is Article 6 (1) (1) point (c) of the GDPR. At the end of the statutory retention periods stipulated by the commercial and tax laws, we shall erase your order data.</li>
