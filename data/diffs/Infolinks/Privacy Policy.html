<p>Effective: Jan 1, 2019.  </p>
<p>Infolinks Media, LLC (AKA, Infolinks) is an advertising technology company that provides a variety of online advertising-related services. We respect all concerns about privacy issues and want you to be familiar with how we collect, use, and share information and how you can exercise the privacy rights available to you.  This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) covers the information that we may process:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>About End Users through our Ad Services and Technology; and</li>
<li>About individuals who visit, use, or interact with the Infolinks Properties.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are resident in the European Economic Area and want to find out more about the specifics of your data protection rights, please see “EEA Data Protection Rights” below.</p>
<p diff:insert="" class="diff-inserted">To opt out of Infolinks Media ads <a href="https://www.infolinks.com/opt-out/">click here</a>.</p><p><strong>SECTION 1 – WHO WE ARE</strong></p>
<p>Infolinks provides advertising automation technology via our supply side platform (“Platform”) and related advertising tools (collectively the “Ad Services”).  We provide our services and tools to our “Clients,” which include “Publisher Clients” who own and operate websites, mobile applications, and other online services (each a “Digital Property”) and “Media Buyers” who are advertisers and other ad partners looking to distribute ad content through our Platform to our “Publisher Clients”.  Our Ad Services help Clients display relevant online advertising to end users (“End Users”) who interact with Digital Properties that use our Ad Services.</p>
<p>Infolinks also collects information from individuals when they visit, use, or interact with: (i) <a href="http://www.infolinks.com">www.infolinks.com</a> and other websites operated by us, including Infolinks’ client interfaces (the “Websites”); (ii) our software applications (the “Apps”); (iii) our social media pages (our “Social Media Pages”); and (iv) our sales and marketing activities (collectively, our “Infolinks Properties”).</p>
<p><strong>SECTION 2 – PRIVACY FOR OUR AD SERVICES</strong></p>
<p>This Section describes how we collect and use information we receive from End Users of Digital Properties that use our Ad Services.</p>
<p><strong>2.1       WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</strong></p>
<p>Information we automatically collect</p>
<p>When End Users visit a Digital Property that uses our technology, we (and our partners or vendors) use and deploy tracking technologies like cookies to automatically collect certain information about the End Users and their devices.  Some of this information (including, for example, unique identifiers stored in a cookie or mobile advertising IDs) may identify a computer or device and may be “personal data” in some jurisdictions, including the EU.  However, our Ad Services and Technology are designed to process information in such a manner that the information cannot be directly attributed to a specific, identifiable individual without the use of additional information (such as your name, address, or email address). In addition, we adhere to individual privacy laws in each jurisdiction.</p>
<p>We (and our partners or vendors) may collect this information the first time an End User interacts with a Publisher Client’s Digital Property that uses our Ad Services, and we may combine and associate this information with information we (or our partners) may collect about the End User’s interactions with other ads served through our Platform.</p>
<p>The information we may collect includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browser and Device information, such as the device type and model, manufacturer, operating system type and version (e.g. iOS or Android), web browser type and version (e.g., Chrome or Safari), user-agent, carrier name, time zone, network connection type (e.g., Wi-Fi or cellular), IP address, general location inferred from IP address, information about our Publisher Client’s apps and versions currently active on a device (but not any other apps), and identifiers assigned to a device, such as its iOS Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), Android/Google Advertising ID (AAID or GAID), or other unique device identifier (typically an alphanumeric string allocated to a device by the device manufacturer, a Publisher Client’s Digital Property, or Infolinks, including identifiers stored in a cookie, or browser or web cache).</li>
<li>Information about an End User’s behavior on our Publisher Clients’ Digital Properties, such as information about the activities or actions on those Digital Properties, session start/stop time, and geolocation (including latitude and longitude coordinates, but only if the Publisher Client’s Digital Property (like an app) has enabled location services on the device and the End User has granted the Publisher Client permission to collect and share this information for advertising purposes).</li>
<li>Information about ads served, viewed, or clicked on, such as the type of ad, where the ad was served, whether the End User clicked on it, the number of times an End User has seen the ad, and whether the End User visited the Media Buyer’s website or relevant app store and/or purchased or installed the product or service advertised.</li>
</ul>
<p>Information we receive from third parties</p>
<p>We may also combine, merge and/or enhance the information we collect about an End User with information collected from our Publisher Clients and third parties (like our data providers).  For example, our Publisher Clients may also collect information that they choose to pass to us either directly through our Ad Services or through application programming interfaces (APIs), when our Ad Services connect to their systems.</p>
<p><strong>2.2       HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we collect for a variety of business purposes.  For example, we use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Serving Ads: To allow Publisher Clients to offer advertising inventory in their Digital Properties and Media Buyers to bid on and fill that inventory with relevant ads.</li>
<li>Ad Reporting and Conversions: To provide information and reports to Media Buyers about when and how End Users have been exposed to their ads, clicked on their ads, or visited their Digital Property.</li>
<li>Fraud Detection and Prevention and Security: To identify invalid ad impressions, clicks, installs, or ad queries, protect us and our Publisher Clients from fraudulent behavior, and protect the security of the Ad Services.</li>
<li>Frequency Capping: To prevent End Users from seeing the same ad too many times.</li>
<li>Customizing Ads: To infer End Users’ likely commercial interests (<em>g</em>., sports or travel) based on their activities across websites, mobile apps, and other Digital Properties over time, including to build interest-based advertising segments or audiences, as well as to supplement the information we collect with additional information we receive from third parties, such as third-party advertising segments or audiences, to allow us to customize and more effectively tailor the ads we display to End Users and to optimize the display of ads (including limiting exposure to less relevant ads).</li>
<li>Performance Analytics: To analyze ad performance, such as tracking views of ads, as well as click-through rates to websites or app stores and/or installs of apps that have been advertised.</li>
<li>Contextual-Based Advertising: To serve contextually relevant targeted ads to an End User on behalf of our Clients based on the End User’s activity across websites, mobile apps, and other Digital Properties over time and information regarding an End User’s inferred commercial interests.</li>
<li>Location-Based Advertising: To deliver location-based advertising, services, and content in real-time using your device’s physical location (where permitted by law).</li>
<li>Providing, Managing, and Improving our Ad Services and Developing New Services: To facilitate navigation, display information more effectively, and to personalize your experience while using the Ad Services, as well as auditing, researching, and analyzing information to provide, protect, manage, and improve our Ad Services, develop new services, and ensure that our technologies function properly.</li>
<li>Service Usage and Support: To calculate usage levels of the Ad Services, help diagnose server problems, and administer the Ad Services.</li>
<li>As we believe to be necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside an End User’s country of residence; (b) to comply with subpoenas, warrants, or other legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities including public and government authorities outside an End User’s country of residence; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates, End Users, or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2.3       COOKIES AND SIMILAR TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</strong></p>
<p>We use cookies and other similar tracking technologies (such as pixel tags and web or browser caches) to collect information automatically from End Users’ devices.  They help us identify unique browsers or devices used by an End User and to perform functions like, for example, limiting the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed on our Publisher Clients’ Digital Properties, and serving an ad to the End User.  To opt out of our use of such technologies for interest-based advertising purposes. </p>

<p><strong>4.4       LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION (EEA END USERS AND VISITORS ONLY)</strong></p>
<p>If you are a resident of the EEA, our legal basis for collecting and using personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.  However, we normally rely on our legitimate interests to collect personal information from you, except where such interests are overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. Where we rely on our legitimate interests to process your personal information, they include the interests described in the sections above.</p>
<p>In some cases, we may rely on your consent or have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person. If we rely on consent to collect and/or process your personal information, we will obtain such consent in compliance with applicable laws.</p>

<p><strong>4.5       THIRD PARTIES</strong></p>
<p>This Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information, or other practices of any third parties, including our vendors or any other third party operating any site or service to which the Ad Services or Infolinks Properties link. The inclusion of a link through the Ad Services or Online Property does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our affiliates.</p>
<p>Please note that we are not responsible for the collection, usage and disclosure policies and practices (including the data security practices) of other organizations, such as Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft or any other digital properties, app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider or device manufacturer, including any personal information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with the Ad Services or Infolinks Properties.</p>
<p><strong>4.6      HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURE?</strong></p>
<p>We use reasonable organizational, technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect the personal information we collect and process.  The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information and to help ensure that your data is safe and secure.  However, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with the “Contacting Us” section below.</p>
<p><strong>4.7       RETENTION OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We will retain personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy and where we have ongoing legitimate business needs to do so (for example, to provide the Ad Services, to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements, to enforce our agreements or comply with our legal obligations) unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>
<p>If you are an End User, we may retain information that we collect through the Ad Services based on our data retention limitations, or indefinitely.  We use precise geolocation for the specific ad impression to which the geolocation relates, after which the geolocation information is aggregated with other geolocation data for use by us for analytical purposes.  If we de-identify information we collect through the Ad Services, we may retain that information, in an aggregated format, indefinitely.  In such cases, we commit to not re-identifying the information.  If we are required to retain information to comply with a legal or audit obligation, we may store End User information for longer periods.</p>
<p><strong>4.8       INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</strong></p>
<p>The Infolinks Properties and Ad Services are provided, supported, and hosted in the United States.  If you are using these from outside the United States, be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal information, in the United States and other locations.  These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country of residence.</p>
<p>However, we have taken specific and appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with the EEA and European Union data protection law. </p>
<p><strong>4.9     UPDATES TO THIS POLICY</strong></p>
<p>We will review and update this Policy periodically and will note the date of its most recent revision at the top of this Policy.  If we make material changes to this Policy, we will post the revised Policy on our website and may take additional measures to inform you about such changes if required by applicable data protection laws.  We encourage you to review this Policy frequently to be informed of how Infolinks is protecting your information.</p>

<p><strong>SECTION 5 – EEA Data Rights Explained</strong></p>

<li>No cookie syncing or cookie targeting by default unless compliant</li>
<li>Pass a digital ‘No-Consent’ notification to all advertising partners by default</li>
<li>Ensure any vendor activated on our publishers have appropriate compliance</li>
<li>working with publishers to receive valid ‘User Consent’</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, Residents of some countries, including those in the European Economic Area, have data subject rights available to them under applicable data protection laws. These rights may include the right to request access to, or to request erasure or portability of, your personal information.  You may also have a right to object to, or request that we restrict, processing of your personal information.  Where such rights apply, we will comply with requests to exercise these rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
<p>If you make a request to access personal information we hold about you (also known as an “access request”), we will provide the Digital Identifiers of your browser(s) and/or device(s) that we may store. Additionally, we may also provide you with certain other information that we may have stored and associated with your Digital Identifiers.</p>

<p><strong>SECTION 5A – Additional Information for California Residents Explained</strong></p>

<p><em>Your Rights</em></p>
<p>California law requires us to disclose the categories of personal information we collect and how we use them, the categories of sources from which we collect personal information, and the third parties with whom we share personal information, which we have explained above.

You also have the right to request what information we collect and how we use and disclose it. You may exercise these rights by ​submiting our disclosure form.

If you have any questions about your rights or our disclosures, you may reach us at ​+1.INFO.LNK</p>

<p><strong>HOW TO MAKE A DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS REQUEST</strong></p>
<p>If you wish to make a data subject rights request, please follow the steps described below:</p>
<p>Step 1: Locate Your Digital Identifiers</p>
<p>In order for us to locate relevant records, we will need you to provide us with your Digital Identifiers. You can find your Digital Identifiers as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web Browsing</li>
</ul>
<p>As described throughout the Privacy Policy our technology operates by using text files called “cookies” that are placed on your device. See the applicable policy for more information about the cookies we use, and how to manage cookies and other similar technologies. Some of the cookies we use include a Digital Identifier. To locate these Digital Identifiers, you can search through your cookies for the cookies named in our cookie policies (which are set from the Infolinks domain). The text in each of these cookies is a separate Digital Identifier.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that different cookies are placed on each browser and device that you use to access the Internet. As a result, if you use multiple browsers (for example, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox) and devices (for example, a laptop computer and a mobile phone), you will need to locate the applicable cookies for each browser and device.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile Devices</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, certain mobile devices (for example, mobile phones or tablets using the iOS or Android operating systems) generate a persistent “Advertising Identifier” per device, which, among other things, can be used by third parties for purposes of providing you with targeted advertising. On iOS devices, your Advertising Identifier may be referred to as an “IDFA,” “IFA,” or an “ID for Advertising.” On Android devices, your Advertising Identifier may be referred to as an “Advertising ID.” Please follow instructions from your mobile device manufacturer on how to locate your specific Advertising Identifiers.</p>
<p>Step 2: Verify Your Digital Identifiers</p>
<p>In order to make sure that we are responding only to the person who is authorized to make the access request, we also will need some supporting proof to demonstrate that you are indeed connected to the Digital Identifiers you located in Step 1. For Digital Identifiers stored in cookies, please take a screenshot of each cookie, taking care to make sure that the screenshot shows both the name of the cookie and the full Digital Identifier. For Digital Identifiers located on a mobile device, please take a screenshot of a screen that displays the Digital Identifier. Additionally, please fill out, sign and include in your request the ‘Infolinks Data Authorization Form’ in Section -A- below that we have prepared, which attests that the Digital Identifiers you have located are indeed associated with you. By signing the form, you declare, under penalty of perjury, that all statements made on the form are true, and you must also have a witness sign and date the form. By signing the form, the witness declares, under penalty of perjury, that your signature on the form is genuine. In addition, you and the witness must each provide a copy of one identifying document, such as a passport or driver’s license. The names on the document copies must match the printed names on the Authorization Verification Form. We require these steps to help us verify that you, as the data subject of the personal information you have requested, are authorized to request and receive such personal information.</p>
