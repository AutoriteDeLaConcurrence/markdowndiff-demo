<p>The programme policies listed below apply to content when using Google Classroom with a personal Google Account. This includes all Classroom features, such as course names, information shared in the class stream, communications and collaboration between teachers, students and class materials. The programme policies listed below play an important role in maintaining a positive experience for everyone using Google products. </p>
<p>We need to curb abuse that threatens our ability to provide these services, and we ask that everyone abides by the policies below to help us achieve this goal. After we are notified of a potential policy violation, we may review the content and take action, including restricting access to the content, removing the content and limiting or terminating a user’s access to Google products.</p>
<p>When applying these policies, we may make exceptions based on educational, documentary, scientific or artistic considerations, or where there are other substantial benefits to the public from not taking action on the content. </p>
<p>Make sure that you check back from time to time, as these policies may change. Please also refer to <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en-GB">Google’s Terms of Service</a>, Privacy Policy and the terms of service and policies for Workspace services, including Google Drive, Docs, Gmail and Calendar.</p>
<h2 id="report-abuse">Report abuse</h2>

<p>To report copyright infringement or other legal issues, please use this <a href="https://support.google.com/legal/troubleshooter/1114905">tool</a> which will guide you through the process of reporting content that you believe warrants removal from Google's services based on applicable laws.</p>
<h2 id="programme-policies">Programme policies</h2>
<p>Account hijacking</p>
<p>Do not access another user's account without their permission. We may take appropriate action if we are notified of account hijacking, which may include reporting you to the relevant authorities, removing access to some of our products or disabling your Google Account.</p>
<p>Child sexual abuse and endangerment</p>
<p>Do not create, upload or distribute content that exploits or abuses children. This includes all child sexual abuse materials. To report content on a Google product that may exploit a child, click '<a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/2463296">Report abuse</a>'. If you find content elsewhere on the Internet, please contact <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/148666">the appropriate agency in your country</a> directly.</p>
<p>More broadly, Google prohibits the use of our products to endanger children. This includes but is not limited to, predatory behaviour towards children such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘Child grooming’ (for example, befriending a child online to facilitate, either online or offline, sexual contact and/or exchanging sexual imagery with that child);</li>
<li>‘Sextortion’ (for example, threatening or blackmailing a child by using real or alleged access to a child’s intimate images);</li>
<li>Sexualisation of a minor (for example, imagery that depicts, encourages or promotes the sexual abuse of children or the portrayal of children in a manner that could result in the sexual exploitation of children); and</li>
<li>Trafficking of a child (for example, advertising or solicitation of a child for commercial sexual exploitation).</li>
</ul>
<p>We will remove such content and take appropriate action, which may include reporting to the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children, limiting access to product features and disabling accounts. If you believe that a child is in danger of or has been subject to abuse, exploitation or trafficking, contact the police immediately. If you have already made a report to the police and still need help or you have concerns that a child is or was being endangered on our products, you can <a href="https://support.google.com/families/contact/report_child_grooming">report the behaviour to Google</a>.</p>
<p>Circumvention</p>
<p>Do not engage in actions intended to bypass our policies or subvert restrictions placed on your account. This includes the creation or use of multiple accounts or other methods intended to engage in behaviour that was previously prohibited. We may take appropriate action if we are notified of circumvention, which may include reporting you to the relevant authorities, removing access to some of our products or disabling your Google Account.</p>

<p>Do not use this product to engage in illegal activities or to promote activities, goods, services or information that cause serious and immediate harm to people or animals.
