<p><strong>What is Silk?</strong></p>
<p>Silk is a web browser available on compatible Fire Tablet, Fire TV, and Echo devices that allows you to quickly and easily access your favorite websites. With Silk, you can get the latest news, check your e-mail, shop at your favorite store, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Does Silk collect personal information?</strong></p>
<p>Silk collects personal information in order to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products and services that Amazon offers our customers. Personal information collected by Amazon is subject to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/privacy">Amazon.com Privacy Notice</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What personal information does Silk collect about the websites that I visit?</strong></p>
<p>Silk stores a history of the websites you’ve visited on a particular device, to allow you to easily find the websites you visit most or to search for a particular web page you previously visited. This browsing history is stored locally on your device. You can view, search, selectively clear, or clear your browsing history from your History tab. Navigate to the History tab by selecting History <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/support_images/GUID-D466ADFD-9C06-4851-A2A3-825D5ED1565E_en-US.jpg" alt="history"> from one of the Silk menus (<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/support_images/GUID-512A76B7-C038-4242-B51E-6EECED8FFA3D_en-US.png" alt="burger"> or <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/support_images/GUID-C964D580-E8A4-4E5C-8B35-6DA195BFB292_en-US.png" alt="three dots">).</p>
<p>You can also enable features that send information about the websites that you visit to Amazon.</p>
<p>See the FAQ regarding Private Browsing, below, for more about how to manage your Silk browsing history.</p>
<p diff:delete="" class="diff-deleted">You can also enable features that send information about the websites that you visit to Amazon.</p>
<p>If you use Amazon Silk on an Amazon device, your device may send logs or crash reports to Amazon that include the URL where Silk ran into an issue or recent browsing history. These logs or reports may contain identifiers such as IP addresses or device IDs. We may use this information to help us troubleshoot the browser and improve its performance. <strong><insert>How do Silk customized recommendations work ?</insert></strong></p>
<p diff:delete="" class="diff-deleted"><strong>How do Silk customized recommendations work?</strong></p>
<p>Customized recommendations is a feature available on some Fire tablets. If you enable customized recommendations, Silk helps you find content (such as articles or websites) that you might like based on your browsing activity, such as the websites you visit and how long you spend on each webpage. We do not connect this information to your Amazon account. You can control this feature within the Silk Privacy settings.</p>
<p><strong>What information is shared when I use a search engine in Silk’s address bar?</strong></p>
<p>The text you enter in Silk's address bar is sent to a third-party search engine so that it can provide you with search-related features, such as suggesting relevant search terms or providing results in response to your search query. To personalize these features, the search engine may store a cookie on your device and access this cookie when you use the address bar or visit its websites. Amazon Silk selects the initial search engine to which text in the address bar is sent, and we may change the search engine in the future without notice to you. In the Silk settings, you can change your search engine, enable or disable the personalization of suggested search terms, or clear cookies stored by websites. The search engine’s privacy policy applies to information that it collects.</p>
<p><strong>What is Private Browsing?</strong></p>
<p>When you use Private Browsing, pages you view when using a Private tab will be removed from your Silk browsing history after the tab is closed. Any files you download or bookmarks you create will be kept. In Private Browsing, your activity might still be visible to your internet service provider or the websites you visit (including websites affiliated with Amazon). To enable Private Browsing, select the “New Private Tab” option in the Silk menu.</p>
<p><strong>What about cookies?</strong></p>
<p>Cookies are a small file that websites may store on your device to keep you signed in, remember your site preferences, or provide you with relevant content. The privacy policy of a third-party website applies to the information that is collected when you visit it. In the Silk Privacy settings, you can clear cookies stored on your device by websites. For information about cookies, pixels, and other technologies on Amazon-affiliated websites, see our <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GVASXV5UZ64R4Y25">Cookies Notice</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How does the Silk Bookmarks extension work?</strong></p>
<p>Silk Bookmarks is an extension (plug-in) available for the Google Chrome browser that allows you to save a copy of your Chrome bookmarks to your Amazon account, so that they’re available on Fire tablets. For more information, see our <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201829650">help page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Can I back up my Silk settings and bookmarks?</strong></p>
<p>On Fire tablets, you can back up your Silk settings, including your bookmarks, to the Amazon cloud by enabling the Backup and Restore feature. For more information, see the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201604180">Backup and Restore FAQ</a>.</p>
