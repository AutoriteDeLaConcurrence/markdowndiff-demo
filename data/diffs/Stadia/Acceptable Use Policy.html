<p>Last modified: November 5, 2019</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>BY ACCESSING INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT CONTENT (“CONTENT”) ON STADIA, YOU AGREE TO<br>
THE TERMS OF THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR CONTENT (“EULA”). This EULA is an<br>
agreement between you and the Content publisher (“Publisher”), and governs your use of Content unless<br>
you have entered into a separate agreement with the Publisher governing your use of the Content. The<br>
identity of the Publisher of Content can be found on the applicable details page on Stadia. Where the<br>
Publisher is not Google LLC or its affiliates (“Google”): (A) Publisher (and not Google) is solely<br>
responsible for the Content; and (B) Google is a third-party beneficiary to this EULA and has the right to<br>
enforce its terms. Where Google is the Publisher of Content, this EULA does not apply and your use of<br>
such Content is governed by the Stadia Terms of Service.</p>
<h2 id="license">License</h2>
<p>The Content is licensed to you, not sold. Publisher grants you a limited, non-exclusive license to access<br>
and use the Content for which you have an entitlement for your personal, non-commercial use through<br>
Stadia. The Publisher reserves all rights in and to the Content that are not expressly granted to you under<br>
this EULA.</p>
<h2 id="updates-and-services">Updates and Services</h2>
<p>Publisher may update the Content from time to time in its discretion, but is not obligated to provide you<br>
with any such updates. If Publisher provides any online services in connection with your use of the<br>
Content, such services may be modified or discontinued at any time.</p>
<h2 id="warranties-and-disclaimers">Warranties and Disclaimers</h2>
<p>OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS EULA, PUBLISHER AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, AND<br>
DISTRIBUTORS DO NOT MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE CONTENT OR RELATED SERVICES.<br>
FOR EXAMPLE, PUBLISHER MAKES NO COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE SUITABILITY OF GAME CONTENT,<br>
GAME FUNCTIONALITY, OR CONTENT RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS.<br>
PUBLISHER PROVIDES THE CONTENT AND ANY RELATED SERVICES “AS IS”. SOME JURISDICTIONS<br>
PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS<br>
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW,<br>
PUBLISHER EXCLUDES ALL WARRANTIES.</p>
<h2 id="limitation-of-liability">Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>WHEN PERMITTED BY LAW, PUBLISHER AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, AND DISTRIBUTORS WILL<br>
NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA, FINANCIAL LOSSES, OR INDIRECT,<br>
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL<br>
LIABILITY OF PUBLISHER AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, AND DISTRIBUTORS FOR ANY CLAIMS<br>
UNDER THIS EULA, INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID<br>
TO ACCESS THE CONTENT. IN ALL CASES, PUBLISHER AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, AND<br>
DISTRIBUTORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT REASONABLY<br>
FORESEEABLE.</p>
<h2 id="general">General</h2>
<p>The terms of this EULA may be modified from time to time. You should look at the terms regularly. Notice<br>
of modifications to these terms will be posted on this page. Changes will not apply retroactively and will<br>
become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new<br>
functions or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If there is a conflict between<br>
these terms and the Stadia TOS, the Stadia TOS will control for that conflict.<br>
If you do not comply with these terms, and Publisher does not take action right away, this doesn’t mean<br>
Publisher is giving up any rights that Publisher may have (such as taking action in the future).<br>
The laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California’s conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes<br>
arising out of or relating to this EULA or the Content. All claims arising out of or relating to this EULA or<br>
the Content will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California,<br>
USA, and you and Publisher consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.<br>
If it turns out that a particular term in this EULA is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.</p>
