It is open to users of the Services who are <strong>aged 16 or older</strong> and is subject to the following terms and conditions of this Virtual Items Policy (the “Policy). </p>
<p>Users between 16 and 18 (or age of majority in your jurisdiction) must have parents or legal guardian’s full permission to participate in the Program.  </p>
<p>Who is eligible to participate in the Program?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Select users, aged 16 or above may participate in the Program. Such users shall be selected exclusively at the discretion of the Platform on the basis of various criteria including their track record in creating quality content, number of followers etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Users can only buy Coins and Gifts, send Gifts to others, receive Gifts with monetary value, earn Diamonds and withdraw Diamonds if they are aged 18 (or age of majority in your jurisdiction) or older.</p></li>

<strong>Who can buy Coins?</strong> </h3>
<ul>
<li>Users of our Services who are <strong>aged 18 (or age of majority in your jurisdiction) or older</strong> may purchase virtual “coins” (“<strong>Coins</strong>”) from us using authorised payment methods and through payment providers made available and authorized by us.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="purchasing-coins"><strong>Purchasing Coins</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The price of the Coins will be displayed at the point of purchase. All charges and payments for Coins will be made in the currency specified at the point of purchase through the relevant payment mechanism. Currency exchange settlements, foreign transaction fees and payment channel fees, if any, are based on your agreement with the applicable payment provider. </p></li>
<li><p>You will be responsible for the payment of any Coins purchased by you. Once your purchase has been completed, your user account will be credited with Coins.</p></li>
<li><p>If you wish to make changes to your purchase, please contact us at the email address set out below. We will let you know if this change is possible. Please note that changes may impact price as well as other aspects of your purchase. If you live in the European Union, you have certain rights to withdraw from a purchase under the Consumer Rights Directive and its implementing legislation. However, if you purchase Coins, you acknowledge and agree that we start supplying the Coins to you as soon as the purchase is complete and therefore, your right to cancel or withdraw from the agreement to purchase is lost at this point.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-you-can-use-coins"><strong>How you can use Coins</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Coins can be used to purchase Virtual Gifts.  Coins cannot be exchanged for cash, or legal tender, or currency of any state, region, or any political entity, or any other form of credit. </p></li>
<li><p>Coins can only be used on our Platform and as part of our Services, and cannot be combined or used in conjunction with other promotions, coupons, discounts or special offers, except those designated by us.</p></li>
<li><p>No Coins may be assigned or transferred to any other user of the Services or third party except as expressly permitted by us in writing. The sale, barter, assignment or other disposal of any Coins, other than by us, is expressly prohibited. </p></li>
<li><p>Accrued Coins do not constitute property and are not transferable: (a) upon death; (b) as part of a domestic relations matter; or (c) otherwise by operation of law. </p></li>
<li><p>Any Coins assigned, sold, or otherwise transferred without the express written consent of us are void. Any user of the Services who violates this restriction may have his or her account terminated us, forfeit Coins from his or her account, and/or be subject to liability for damages and litigation and transaction costs.</p></li>
<li><p>All Coins of a user will expire automatically upon termination of the user’s account for any reason. </p></li>
<li><p>You agree that we have the right to manage, regulate, control, modify and/or eliminate such Coins, where we have a valid reason to do so such as where we reasonably believe you have violated this Policy, you are in breach of any applicable law or regulation or for legal, security or technical reasons and that we will have no liability to you based on our  exercise of such right. If we decided to eliminate Coins from our services completely, we will do so by providing reasonable notice to you.  </p></li>

<li><p>Although we aim to fulfil all withdrawal requests in a timely manner, we do not guarantee fulfilment within a specific period of time (including any estimated timings set out at the time of withdrawal) and we will not be liable to you or any third party for any failure to fulfil a withdrawal request within such time.</p></li>
<li><p>If you wish to convert the amount into a currency other than USD, this option may be available within your PayPal (or other payment channel if applicable) account but this is at the discretion of PayPal (or other payment channel if applicable) and the terms and conditions of PayPal (or other payment channel if applicable), including any applicable fees, will apply to such currency conversion. </p></li>
