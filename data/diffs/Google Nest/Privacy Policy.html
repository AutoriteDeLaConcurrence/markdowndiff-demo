<h3 id="cameras">Cameras</h3>
<p>Cameras serve a variety of purposes in the home, such as capturing memories, connecting with loved<delete> ones</delete><insert> ones,</insert> and helping you feel secure. Devices like Nest Cam use video to help you keep an eye on your home and alert you when things happen, even when you’re not there.</p>
<p>For all our connected home devices with cameras, we commit to you:</p>
<p>Your camera sends video footage to Google only if you or someone in your home has explicitly turned the camera on or enabled a feature that needs it (such as Nest Cam monitoring). You can always turn the camera off.</p>
<p>When your camera is turned on and sending video footage to Google, we will provide a clear visual indicator (such as a green light on your device).</p>
<p>When video footage is stored with your Google Account (for example, via a subscription to Nest Aware), you can access,<delete> review</delete><insert> review,</insert> and delete this footage at any time.</p>
<p>We will only share video footage with third-party apps and services that work with our devices if you or a member of your home explicitly gives us permission.</p>
<p><delete>Where available,</delete> Nest Hub Max offers on-device camera sensing features that help you<delete> personalise</delete><insert> personalize</insert> and control your<delete> experiences</delete><insert> experience</insert> based on what the camera sees, such as Face Match (which helps your device<delete> recognise</delete><insert> recognize</insert> you) and Quick Gestures (which helps you control your device). Once enabled, these on-device camera sensing features don’t send video or images from your Nest Hub Max to Google.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-i-review-and-delete-my-stored-video-footage">How can I review and delete my stored video footage?</h3>
<p>You can review and delete stored<delete> video footage</delete><insert> audio recordings</insert> either through the Nest app (in the case of Nest Cam recordings) or <a href="https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity"> My Activity </a> (for interactions with Google Assistant).</p>
<h3 id="do-nest-hub-maxs-camera-sensing-features-ever-send-video-or-images-from-my-home-to-google">Do Nest Hub Max’s camera sensing features ever send video or images from my home to Google?</h3>
<p>Yes, but only as part of the Face Match setup process, and not after you’ve completed setup. When you set up Face Match on your Nest Hub Max, you use your phone to capture several photos that are combined to create a unique model of your face. These photos are sent to Google, and you can review or delete them<delete> at any time</delete><insert> anytime</insert> by visiting <a href="https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity"> My Activity </a> . After this setup process, Face Match does not send any video or images to Google. And Quick Gestures does not require sending any video or images to Google at all. In addition, we keep the video and images that power these features separate from advertising and don’t use them for ad<delete> personalisation.</delete><insert> personalization.</insert></p>

Also, remember<delete> that</delete> you can use your device’s camera with other Google services (such as uploading a video to YouTube or making a video call with Google<delete> Duo, where available)</delete><insert> Duo)</insert> – and when you do this, Google’s <span href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB" diff:delete-formatting="" old-formatting="a" class="diff-deleted-formatting"><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US" diff:insert-formatting="" class="diff-target-changed tooltipped " aria-label="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB -&gt; https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US">Privacy Policy</a></span> </p>
<h3 id="are-there-times-when-video-footage-is-sent-to-google-servers-without-a-visual-indicator">Are there times when video footage is sent to Google servers without a visual indicator?</h3>
<p>Some models of our cameras support recording video footage while offline. For these cameras, video footage will be uploaded when the camera goes back online after the video footage has been recorded. That means you may not see a visual indicator when your camera is sending the video footage to our servers<delete> –</delete><insert> --</insert> but in those instances, a visual indicator would have been visible when the camera was actually recording the video footage.</p>
<h3 id="microphones">Microphones</h3>
<p>Microphones serve a variety of purposes in the home, such as letting you control devices throughout your home using just your voice, detecting unexpected activity in your home when you’re not there, and making a voice call using a smart speaker or display.</p>
<p>For all our connected home devices with microphones, we commit to you:</p>
<p>Your device will only send audio to Google if we detect that you or someone in your home is interacting with your Assistant (for example, by saying<delete> 'Hey Google'),</delete><insert> “Hey Google”),</insert> or if you use a feature that needs it (for example,<delete> where available,</delete> sound alerts on Nest Cam, or Nest Cam video recording with audio enabled). You can always turn the microphone off.</p>
<p>When your microphone is turned on and sending audio to Google, we will provide a clear visual indicator (such as flashing dots on top of your device or an on-screen indicator).</p>

<p>Sometimes, such as when it is faster to<delete> fulfil</delete><insert> fulfill</insert> your Google Assistant request locally, on the device, your audio recording will be transmitted to Google servers only after the visual indicator has turned off and your request has been fulfilled. In these instances, the visual indicator will be visible when the microphone is active, as opposed to when the audio data is transmitted to Google servers.</p>
<h3 id="home-sensors">Home sensors</h3>
<p>Some of our devices include sensors that detect information about your home’s environment and what’s happening in it, such as motion, whether or not someone is<delete> at</delete> home, ambient light,<delete> temperature</delete><insert> temperature,</insert> and humidity. These sensors serve a variety of purposes, such as helping your home take better care of you – like when your Nest Learning<delete> Thermostat, where available,</delete><insert> Thermostat</insert> turns itself down when you’re away – and helping us make your devices and services better.</p>
<p>For all our connected home devices with these environmental and activity sensors, we commit to you:</p>
<p>We’ll help you understand how the sensor readings collected from your home environment are used in our devices and services. That’s why we’ve published this <a href="https://support.google.com/googlehome/?p=sensorglossary#topic=7029677">guide to sensors in our devices</a>.</p>

<p>Our devices include environmental and activity sensors that detect information about your home’s environment and what’s happening in it, such as motion, whether or not someone is home, ambient light,<delete> temperature</delete><insert> temperature,</insert> and humidity. Data from these sensors, which is regularly sent to Google, serves a variety of purposes, such as helping your home take better care of you, helping us make your devices and services better, and keeping you informed. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The temperature and humidity sensors in your Nest Learning<delete> Thermostat, where available,</delete><insert> Thermostat</insert> help keep your home comfortable while saving energy.</li>
<li>Home/Away Assist uses activity sensors across multiple Nest devices in your home to automatically switch the<delete> behaviour</delete><insert> behavior</insert> of Nest devices in your home when you leave and when you come back.</li>
<li>We used ambient light and temperature sensor data aggregated from thermostats across our customers to determine that direct sunlight can cause thermostats to think it’s warmer than it actually is, so we introduced <a href="https://nest.com/support/article/What-is-Sunblock"> Sunblock </a> , a new feature, to help your thermostat adjust for this so<delete> that</delete> it sets the correct temperature.</li>
<li>We use sensor data to help us troubleshoot and improve the performance,<delete> safety</delete><insert> safety,</insert> and reliability of our devices and services<delete> ;</delete><insert> –</insert> for example, we use temperature and humidity data from our devices to measure the impact of environmental conditions on battery life.</li>
<li>We may also use sensor data to keep you informed of updates on Google services, including connected home services<delete> that</delete> we think may interest you, such as energy and home safety<delete> programmes, where available</delete><insert> programs</insert> – but we’ll always respect your choice about whether<insert> or not</insert> you want to receive promotional emails from Google.</li>
<li>We do not use environmental and activity sensor data for ad<delete> personalisation.</delete><insert> personalization.</insert> For<delete> example,</delete><insert> example</insert> we don’t use sleep data from your Nest Hub<delete> (2nd gen), where available,</delete><insert> (2nd. gen)</insert> for ad<delete> personalisation.</delete><insert> personalization.</insert> (Remember that to<delete> fulfil</delete><insert> fulfill</insert> some requests related to your connected home devices<delete> –</delete><insert> —</insert> for example,<delete> 'Hey</delete><insert> “Hey</insert> Google, what’s the temperature inside ?<delete> ' –</delete><insert> ” —</insert> your Assistant can retrieve a sensor<delete> reading.)</delete><insert> reading.</insert> Learn more about<insert> the</insert> Google Assistant and the choices available to you <a href="http://myaccount.google.com/yourdata/assistant"> here </a> .)</li>
