<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to you if you are a <strong>Weixin user</strong>. You are a Weixin user if you have either:</p>

<p>WeChat is a global platform. Our engineering, technical, and other support teams are based in our offices around the world (including Singapore and the Netherlands), and may have incidental access to certain of your information, for example, in order to fix technical issues that you report. The Personal Information that we collect from you will be transferred to, stored at, or processed in Singapore and Hong Kong SAR.

<h2 id="7-security-of-your-personal-information">7. SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
<p>We are committed to maintaining the privacy and integrity of your Personal Information no matter where it is stored or accessed. We protect your Personal Information through the use of information security and access policies that limit unauthorised access to our systems, and technological protection measures such as encryption that ensure confidentiality of your Personal Information during transmission and in storage.</p>
<p><strong>We do not permanently retain chat data between you and other users on our servers.</strong> Chat data only passes through our servers so that it can be securely distributed to your intended recipients. Chat data is only stored on your device and the devices of the users that you have sent communications to, <strong>unless your recipient adds any of your communications to their Favorites or it is a message that the owner or administrator of your group chat added as a Group Notice</strong>.</p>
<p>Although we will implement and maintain reasonable measures to protect your Personal Information, please note that as any transmission of information via the internet is never completely secure.</p>

<p>Where we agree to stop processing the Personal Information, we will use reasonable steps to inform any third party to whom we have disclosed the relevant Personal Information so that they can stop processing it too.</p>
<p>You may request we stop processing and just store the Personal Information we hold about you where:</p>
<ul>
