<h3 id="prohibited-content">Prohibited content</h3>
<h4 id="counterfeit-goods"><a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/merchants/answer/6149993">Counterfeit goods</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Google prohibits the sale or promotion for sale of counterfeit products. Counterfeit goods contain a trademark or logo that is identical to or substantially indistinguishable from the trademark or logo of another. They mimic the brand features of the product in an attempt to pass themselves off as a genuine product of the brand owner.</p>
<p>This policy applies to the content of your Shopping ads and your website.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="dangerous-products"><a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/merchants/answer/6150004">Dangerous products</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Google wants to help keep people safe both online and offline, so we don’t allow the promotion of some products that cause damage, harm or injury.</p>
<p><em>Examples of dangerous products:</em> Recreational drugs (chemical or herbal); psychoactive substances; equipment to facilitate drug use; weapons, ammunition, explosive materials and fireworks; instructions for making explosives or other harmful products; tobacco products.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="products-that-enable-dishonest-behaviour"><a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/merchants/answer/6150005">Products that enable dishonest behaviour</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Google values honesty and fairness, so we don’t allow the promotion of products that are designed to enable dishonest behaviour.</p>
<p><em>Examples of products that enable dishonest behaviour:</em> Hacking software or instructions; fake documents; academic cheating products.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="inappropriate-content"><a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/merchants/answer/6149990">Inappropriate content</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Google values diversity and respect for others, and we strive to avoid offending users, so we don’t allow ads or destinations that display shocking content or promote hatred, intolerance, discrimination or violence.</p>
<p><em>Examples of inappropriate or offensive content:</em> Bullying or intimidation of an individual or group; racial discrimination; hate-group paraphernalia; graphic crime-scene or accident images; cruelty to animals; murder; self-harm; extortion or blackmail; sale or trade of endangered species.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="unsupported-shopping-ads-content"><a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/merchants/answer/6150006">Unsupported Shopping ads content</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Google aims to enable businesses to promote a wide variety of products, but some Google products and platforms may not be optimised to appropriately support all content types.</p>
<p>For this reason, Shopping ads and free product listings don't allow the promotion of certain content where we don't offer an optimal user experience.</p>
<p>Note that because these limitations are specific to Shopping ads and free listings, they do not impact policies on other Google products or platforms, where functionality differs or additional support mechanisms are in place.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="prohibited-practices">Prohibited practices</h3>
<h4 id="abuse-of-the-ad-network"><a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/merchants/answer/6150118">Abuse of the ad network</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Google wants Shopping ads to be useful, varied, relevant and safe for users, and so we've made some decisions about how we serve content on our network. As a result we don't allow any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>malicious content</li>
<li>sites that offer little unique value to users and are focused primarily on traffic generation</li>
<li>retailers who attempt to gain an unfair advantage in Shopping campaigns</li>
<li>retailers who attempt to bypass our review processes</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="irresponsible-data-collection--use"><a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/merchants/answer/6150122">Irresponsible data collection &amp; use</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Google wants users to trust that information about them will be respected and handled with appropriate care. As such, our advertising partners should not misuse this information, nor collect it for unclear purposes or without appropriate security measures.</p>
<p><em>Examples of user information that must be handled with care:</em> full name; email address; postal address; phone number; national-identity, pension, national-insurance, tax ID, healthcare or driving-licence number; birthdate or mother's maiden name in addition to any of the above information; financial status; political affiliation; sexual orientation; race or ethnicity; religion.</p>

<h4 id="misrepresentation"><a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/merchants/answer/6150127">Misrepresentation</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Google doesn't want users to feel misled by the content promoted in Shopping ads, and that means being upfront, honest and providing them with the information that they need to make informed decisions. For this reason, we don't allow the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>promotions that prompt users to initiate a purchase, download or other commitment without first providing all relevant information and obtaining the user's explicit consent</li>
<li>promotions that represent you or your products in a way that is not accurate, realistic and truthful</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="restricted-content">Restricted content</h3>
<p>The policies below cover content that is sometimes legally or culturally sensitive. Online promotion can be a powerful way to reach customers, but in sensitive areas, we also work hard to avoid showing these ads when and where they might be inappropriate.</p>
<p>For that reason, we allow promotion of the content below, but on a limited basis. These promotions may not be shown to every user in every location, and merchants may need to meet additional requirements before their ads are eligible to run. Note that not all products, features or networks are able to support this restricted content.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Shopping ads don't restrict use of trademarks by merchants in the title or description of an ad when it's for a trademarked product or a product compatible with the trademarked product.

We'll review claims by trademark owners that use of their trademark is likely to cause consumer confusion about the origin of a product. To submit a trademark-related complaint if you're an owner of the trademark, <a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/contact/policy">use this form</a>.</p>

<blockquote>

We consider ads to be promoting the sale of HFSS products when one or more HFSS food item, beverage or meal is promoted in the ad (text, imagery, audio and/or video) or destination site. Specifically, Shopping ads that contain HFSS foods and beverages are now prohibited from targeting minors.</p>
<p>The information reflected in this policy is not intended to be legal advice and we expect all merchants and partners to comply with the local laws for any region their ads target, including local requirements that may differ from this HFSS food and beverage policy.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="editorial-and-technical-requirements">Editorial and technical requirements</h3>
<p>We want to deliver ads that are engaging for users without being annoying or difficult to interact with, so we've developed editorial requirements to help keep your ads appealing to users. We've also specified technical requirements to help users and advertisers get the most out of the variety of ad formats that we offer.</p>

<p><em>Examples of promotions that don't meet these editorial and professional requirements:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>a Display URL that does not accurately reflect the URL of the landing page, such as 'google.com' taking users to 'gmail.com'</li>

<h2 id="about-our-policies">About our policies</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Shopping ads enable businesses of all sizes, from around the world, to promote a wide variety of products and websites on Google and across our network. We want to help you reach existing and potential customers and audiences. However, to help create a safe and positive experience for users, we listen to their feedback and concerns about the types of ads that they see. We also regularly review changes in online trends and practices, industry norms and regulations. And finally, in crafting our policies, we also think about our values and culture as a company, as well as operational, technical and business considerations. As a result, we have created a set of policies that apply to all promotions on the Google Network.</p>
<p>Google requires that advertisers comply with all applicable laws and regulations and the Google policies described above. It's important that you familiarise yourself with and keep up to date on these requirements for the places where your business operates, as well as any other places that your ads are showing. When we find content that violates these requirements, we may block it from appearing, and in cases of repeated or egregious violations, we may stop you from advertising with us.</p>
