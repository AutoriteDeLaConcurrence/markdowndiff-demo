<ol type="1">
<li><p>view and annotate maps;</p></li>

<li><p>publicly display content with proper attribution online, in video and in print.</p></li>

<li>
<p><strong>Prohibited Conduct.</strong> Your compliance with this Section 2 is a condition of your licence to use Google Maps/Google Earth. When using Google Maps/Google Earth, you may not (or allow those acting on your behalf to):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>redistribute or sell any part of Google Maps/Google Earth or create a new product or service based on Google Maps/Google Earth (unless you use the Google Maps/Google Earth APIs in accordance with their <a diff:change-target="https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/terms/?hl=en-GB -&gt; https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/terms/" class="diff-target-changed tooltipped " aria-label="https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/terms/?hl=en-GB -&gt; https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/terms/">terms of service</a> ) ;</p></li>
<li><p>copy the content (unless you are otherwise permitted to do so by the <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB/permissions/geoguidelines/">Using Google Maps, Google Earth and Street View</a> permissions page or applicable intellectual property law, including "fair use");</p></li>
<li><p>mass download or create bulk feeds of the content (or let anyone else do so);</p></li>
<li><p>use Google Maps/Google Earth to create or augment any other mapping-related dataset (including a mapping or navigation dataset, business listings database, mailing list or telemarketing list) for use in a service that is a substitute for, or a substantially similar service to, Google Maps/Google Earth; or</p></li>
<li><p>use any part of Google Maps/Google Earth with other people's products or services for or in connection with real-time navigation or autonomous vehicle control, except through a specific Google-provided feature such as Android Auto.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Actual Conditions; Assumption of Risk.</strong> When you use Google Maps/Google Earth's map data, traffic, directions and other content, you may find that actual conditions differ from the map results and content, so exercise your independent judgment and use Google Maps/Google Earth at your own risk.

If you are a resident of France, the <a href="https://www.google.com/search/about/terms/france/">Google Search Additional Terms of Service</a> apply to such content which is made publicly available on Google Search. However, content that remains exclusively local to your device (such as a locally-stored KML file) is not uploaded or submitted to Google, and is therefore not subject to that licence.</p></li>

Solely to the extent permitted by federal law: (A) the laws of the State of California (excluding California’s conflict of laws rules) will apply in the absence of applicable federal law; and (B) any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or Google Maps/Google Earth will be litigated exclusively in the federal courts of Santa Clara County, California, and the parties consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.”</p>
