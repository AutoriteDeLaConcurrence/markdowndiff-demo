<p>The programme policies below apply to Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Forms and new Sites. The policies play an important role in maintaining a positive experience for everyone using Google products. <br>
 <br>
We need to curb abuses that threaten our ability to provide these services, and we ask that everyone abide by the policies below to help us achieve this goal. After we are notified of a potential policy violation, we may review the content and take action, including restricting access to the content, removing the content, and limiting or terminating a user’s access to Google products.<br>
 <br>
When applying these policies, we may make exceptions based on artistic, educational, documentary or scientific considerations, or where there are other substantial benefits to the public from not taking action on the content.</p>
<p>We may take action on accounts that go above storage quota limits. For example, we may reject new uploads, compress existing content or delete content if you exceed your storage quota or fail to obtain sufficient additional storage. <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/9312312#changes">Read more about storage quotas here</a>.<br>
 <br>
Make sure that you check back from time to time, as these policies may change. Please also refer to <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en-US">Google's Terms of Service</a> for more information.</p>

<li>Trafficking of a child (for example, advertising or solicitation of a child for commercial sexual exploitation).  </li>
</ul>
<p><br> We will remove such content and take appropriate action, which may include reporting to the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children, limiting access to product features, and disabling accounts. If you believe that a child is in danger of or has been subject to abuse, exploitation or trafficking, contact the police immediately.<insert> If you have already made a report to the police and still need help,</insert> <a href="https://support.google.com/families/contact/report_child_grooming" diff:insert-formatting=""><insert>you can report the behaviour to Google</insert></a><insert> .</insert></p>
