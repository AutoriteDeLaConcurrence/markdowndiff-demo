</ol>
<hr>

<p>3.2 <strong>Application to Controller Services</strong>.

<p>3.3 <strong>Incorporation of Additional Terms for Non-European Data Protection Legislation</strong>. The Additional Terms for Non-European Data Protection Legislation supplement these Controller Terms.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Roles and Restrictions on Processing</li>

<p>4.1 <strong>Independent Controllers</strong>. Subject to Section 4.3 (End Controllers), each party:</p>
<p>(a) is an independent controller of Controller Personal Data under the European Data Protection Legislation;</p>
<p>(b) will individually determine the purposes and means of its processing of Controller Personal Data; and</p>
<p>(c) will comply with the obligations applicable to it under the European Data Protection Legislation regarding the processing of Controller Personal Data.</p>
<p>4.2 <strong>Restrictions on Processing</strong>. Section 4.1 (Independent Controllers) will not affect any restrictions on either party’s rights to use or otherwise process Controller Personal Data under the Agreement.</p>
<p>4.3 <strong>End Controllers</strong>. Without reducing either party’s obligations under these Controller Terms, each party acknowledges that: (a) the other party’s Affiliates or clients may be End Controllers; and (b) the other party may act as a processor on behalf of its End Controllers. The Google End Controllers are: (i) for European Controller Personal Data processed by Google, Google Ireland Limited; and (ii) for UK Controller Personal Data processed by Google, Google LLC. Each party will ensure that its End Controllers comply with the Controller Terms, including (where applicable) the Controller SCCs.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Data Transfers</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>5.1 <strong>Restricted Transfers</strong>. Either party may make Restricted Transfers if it complies with the provisions on Restricted Transfers in the European Data Protection Legislation.</p>
<p>5.2 <strong>Alternative Transfer Solution</strong>. If Google announces its adoption of an Alternative Transfer Solution for any Restricted Transfers, then: (a) Google will ensure that such Restricted Transfers are made in accordance with that Alternative Transfer Solution; and (b) Section 6 (Controller SCCs) will not apply to such Restricted Transfers.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Controller SCCs</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>6.1 <strong>Transfers of European Controller Personal Data to Customer</strong>. To the extent that:</p>
<p>(a) Google transfers European Controller Personal Data to Customer; and</p>
<p>(b) the transfer is a Restricted Transfer,</p>
<p>Customer as data importer will be deemed to have entered into the SCCs (EU Controller-to-Controller) with Google Ireland Limited (the applicable Google End Controller) as data exporter and the transfers will be subject to the SCCs (EU Controller-to-Controller).</p>
<p>6.2 <strong>Transfers of UK Controller Personal Data to Customer</strong>. To the extent that:</p>
<p>(a) Google transfers UK Controller Personal Data to Customer; and</p>
<p>(b) the transfer is a Restricted Transfer,</p>
<p>Customer as data importer will be deemed to have entered into the SCCs (UK Controller-to-Controller) with Google LLC (the applicable Google End Controller) as data exporter and the transfers will be subject to the SCCs (UK Controller-to-Controller).</p>
<p>6.3 <strong>Transfers of European Controller Personal Data to Google</strong>. The parties acknowledge that to the extent Customer transfers European Controller Personal Data to Google, the Controller SCCs are not required because the address of Google Ireland Limited (the applicable Google End Controller) is in an Adequate Country and such transfers are Permitted Transfers. This does not affect Google’s obligations under Section 5.1 (Data Transfers).</p>
<p>6.4 <strong>Transfers of UK Controller Personal Data to Google</strong>. To the extent that Customer transfers UK Controller Personal Data to Google, Customer as data exporter will be deemed to have entered into the SCCs (UK Controller-to-Controller) with Google LLC (the applicable Google End Controller) as data importer and the transfers will be subject to the SCCs (UK Controller-to-Controller), because Google LLC’s address is not in an Adequate Country.</p>
<p>6.5 <strong>Contacting Google; Customer Information</strong>.</p>
<p>(a) Customer may contact Google Ireland Limited and/or Google LLC in connection with the Controller SCCs at <a href="https://support.google.com/policies/troubleshooter/9009584">https://support.google.com/policies/troubleshooter/9009584</a> or through such other means as may be provided by Google from time to time, including for the purposes of requesting an Audit under Section 6.7(a) below, to the extent applicable under the relevant Controller SCCs.</p>
<p>(b) Customer acknowledges that Google is required under the SCCs (EU Controller-to-Controller) to record certain information, including (i) the identity and contact details of the data importer (including any contact person with responsibility for data protection); and (ii) the technical and organisational measures implemented by the data importer. Accordingly, Customer will, where requested and as applicable to Customer, provide such information to Google via such means as may be provided by Google, and will ensure that all information provided is kept accurate and up-to-date.</p>
<p>6.6 <strong>Responding to Data Subject Enquiries</strong>. The applicable data importer will be responsible for responding to enquiries from data subjects and the supervisory authority concerning the processing of applicable Controller Personal Data by the data importer.</p>
<p>6.7 <strong>Reviews, Audits, and Certifications of Compliance</strong>.</p>
<p>(a) If the Controller SCCs apply under this Section 6 (Controller SCCs), the applicable data importer will allow the applicable data exporter or a third party inspection agent or auditor appointed by the data exporter to conduct a review, audit and/or certification as described in the Controller SCCs (“Audit”) in accordance with this Section 6.7 (Reviews, Audits, and Certifications of Compliance).</p>
<p>(b) Following receipt by the data importer of a request for an Audit, the data importer and the data exporter will discuss and agree in advance on the reasonable start date, scope and duration of, and security and confidentiality controls applicable to, the Audit.</p>
<p>(c) The data importer may charge a fee (based on the data importer’s reasonable costs) for any Audit. The data importer will provide the data exporter with further details of any applicable fee, and the basis of its calculation, in advance of the Audit. The data exporter will be responsible for any fees charged by any third party inspection agent or auditor appointed by the data exporter to execute the Audit.</p>
<p>(d) The data importer may object to any third party inspection agent or auditor appointed by the data exporter to conduct any Audit if the inspection agent or auditor is, in the data importer’s reasonable opinion, not suitably qualified or independent, a competitor of the data importer or otherwise manifestly unsuitable. Any such objection by the data importer will require the data exporter to appoint another inspection agent or auditor or conduct the Audit itself.</p>
<p>(e) The data importer will not be required either to disclose to the data exporter or its third party inspection agent or auditor, or to allow the data exporter or its third party inspection agent or auditor to access:</p>
<p>(i) any data of any customers of the data importer or any of its Affiliates;</p>
<p>(ii) any internal accounting or financial information of the data importer or any of its Affiliates;</p>
<p>(iii) any trade secret of the data importer or any of its Affiliates;</p>
<p>(iv) any information that, in the data importer’s reasonable opinion, could: (A) compromise the security of any systems or premises of the data importer or any of its Affiliates; or (B) cause the data importer or any Affiliate of the data importer to breach its obligations under the European Data Protection Legislation or its security and/or privacy obligations to the data exporter or any third party; or</p>
<p>(v) any information that the data exporter or its third party inspection agent or auditor seeks to access for any reason other than the good faith fulfilment of the data exporter’s obligations under the European Data Protection Legislation.</p>
<p>6.8 <strong>Third Party Controllers</strong>. To the extent Google LLC acts as data importer and Customer acts as data exporter under the SCCs (UK Controller-to-Controller) under Section 6.4 (Transfers of UK Controller Personal Data to Google), Google notifies Customer for the purpose of Clause II(i) of the SCCs (UK Controller-to-Controller) that UK Controller Personal Data may be transferred to the third party data controllers where requested by Customer, including through its use of or integration with the Controller Services.</p>

<p>(b) a jurisdiction that is not a state of the United States of America, then the liability of the parties under or in connection with these Controller Terms will be subject to the exclusions and limitations of liability in the Agreement.</p>
