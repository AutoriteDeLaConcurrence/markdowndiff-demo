<h2 id="overview-of-our-policies">Overview of our policies</h2>
<p>We want to support a healthy digital advertising ecosystem—one that is trustworthy and transparent, and works for users, advertisers, and publishers. The purpose of this help center is to help you build Google Ads campaigns that align with our advertising policies listed below. These policies are designed not only to abide by laws but to ensure a safe and positive experience for our users. This means that our policies prohibit some content that we believe to be harmful to users and the overall advertising ecosystem.</p>
<p>We use a combination of automated and human evaluation to ensure Google Ads comply with these policies. </p>
<p>Our advertising policies cover four broad areas:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Google Ads prohibits the sale or promotion for sale of counterfeit goods. Counterfeit goods contain a trademark or logo that is identical to or substantially indistinguishable from the trademark of another.

<blockquote>
<p>We want ads across the Google Network to be useful, varied, relevant, and safe for users. We don’t allow advertisers to run ads, content, or destinations that attempt to trick or circumvent our ad review processes.</p>
<p><em>Examples of abuse of the ad network:</em> promoting content that contains malware; "cloaking" or using other techniques to hide the true destination that users are directed to; "arbitrage" or promoting destinations for the sole or primary purpose of showing ads; promoting "bridge" or "gateway" destinations that are solely designed to send users elsewhere; advertising with the sole or primary intent of gaining public social network endorsements from the user; "gaming" or manipulating settings in an attempt to circumvent our policy review systems</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="data-collection-and-use"><a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6020956">Data collection and use</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>We want users to trust that information about them will be respected and handled with appropriate care. As such, our advertising partners should not misuse this information, nor collect it for unclear purposes or without appropriate disclosures or security measures.</p>
<p>Note that additional policies apply when using <a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/143465">personalized advertising, which includes remarketing and custom audiences.</a> If you use personalized advertising targeting features, be sure to review the personalized ads <a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/143465">data collection and use policies</a>.</p>
<p><em>Examples of user information that should be handled with care:</em> full name; email address; mailing address; phone number; national identity, pension, social security, tax ID, health care, or driver's license number; birth date or mother's maiden name in addition to any of the above information; financial status; political affiliation; sexual orientation; race or ethnicity; religion</p>

<p><em>Examples of misrepresentation:</em> omitting or obscuring billing details such as how, what, and when users will be charged; omitting or obscuring charges associated with financial services such as interest rates, fees, and penalties; failing to display tax or licence numbers, contact information, or physical address where relevant; making offers that aren't actually available; making misleading or unrealistic claims regarding weight loss or financial gain; collecting donations under false pretenses; "phishing" or falsely purporting to be a reputable company in order to get users to part with valuable personal or financial information</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="restricted-content-and-features">Restricted content and features</h2>
<p>The policies below cover content that is sometimes legally or culturally sensitive. Online advertising can be a powerful way to reach customers, but in sensitive areas, we also work hard to avoid showing these ads when and where they might be inappropriate.</p>
<p>For that reason, we allow the promotion of the content below, but on a limited basis. These promotions may not show to every user in every location, and advertisers may need to meet additional requirements before their ads are eligible to run. Note that not all ad products, features, or networks are able to support this restricted content. Further details can be found in the Policy Center.</p>
<h3 id="default-ads-treatment"><a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/10959786">Default Ads Treatment</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Google is committed to delivering a safe and trustworthy ad experience for all users. That’s why we limit serving certain types of ad categories for users that aren't signed in or users that our systems indicate are under 18.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="sexual-content"><a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6023699">Sexual content</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Ads should respect user preferences and comply with legal regulations, so we don't allow certain kinds of sexual content in ads and destinations.  Some kinds of sexual content in ads and destinations are allowed only if they comply with the policies below and don't target minors, but they will only show in limited scenarios based on user search queries, user age, and local laws where the ad is being served. </p>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="alcohol"><a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6012382">Alcohol</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>We abide by local alcohol laws and industry standards, so we don’t allow certain kinds of alcohol-related advertising, both for alcohol and drinks that resemble alcohol. Some types of alcohol-related ads are allowed if they meet the policies below, don’t target minors, and target only countries that are explicitly allowed to show alcohol ads.</p>
<p><em>Examples of restricted alcoholic beverages:</em> beer, wine, sake, spirits or hard alcohol, Champagne, fortified wine, non-alcoholic beer, non-alcoholic wine, and non-alcoholic distilled spirits</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="copyrights"><a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6018015">Copyrights</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>We abide by local copyright laws and protect the rights of copyright holders, so we don’t allow ads that are unauthorized to use copyrighted content. If you are legally authorized to use copyrighted content, <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/contact/copyright">apply for certification</a> to advertise. If you see unauthorized content, <a href="https://support.google.com/legal/troubleshooter/1114905">submit a copyright-related complaint</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We support responsible gambling advertising and abide by local gambling laws and industry standards, so we don’t allow certain kinds of gambling-related advertising. Gambling-related ads are allowed if they comply with the policies below and the advertiser has received the proper Google Ads certification. Gambling ads must target approved countries, have a landing page that displays information about responsible gambling, and never target minors. Check local regulations for the areas you want to target.</p>
<p><em>Examples of restricted gambling-related content:</em> physical casinos; sites where users can bet on poker, bingo, roulette, or sports events; national or private lotteries; sports odds aggregator sites; sites offering bonus codes or promotional offers for gambling sites; online educational materials for casino-based games; sites offering "poker-for-fun" games; non-casino-based cash game sites</p>

Our policies are designed to give users information to weigh the costs associated with financial products and services, and to protect users from harmful or deceitful practices. For the purposes of this policy, we consider financial products and services to be those related to the management or investment of money and cryptocurrencies, including personalized advice.</p>
<p>When promoting financial products and services, you must comply with state and local regulations for any region or country that your ads target — for example, include specific disclosures required by local law. Refer to our non-exhaustive list of <a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6023676">country-specific requirements</a> for more information but note that advertisers are expected to do their own research on the local regulations for any location their ads target.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="trademarks"><a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6118">Trademarks</a></h3>

<p>We restrict certain kinds of businesses from advertising with us to prevent users from being exploited, even if individual businesses appear to comply with our other policies. Based on our own continuous reviews, and feedback from users, regulators, and consumer protection authorities, we occasionally identify products or services that are prone to abuse. If we feel that certain kinds of businesses pose an unreasonable risk to user safety or user experience, then we may limit or stop related ads from running.</p>

<h2 id="editorial--technical-requirements">Editorial &amp; technical requirements</h2>
<p>We want to deliver ads that are engaging for users without being annoying or difficult to interact with, so we've developed editorial requirements to help keep your ads appealing to users. We've also specified technical requirements to help users and advertisers get the most out of the variety of ad formats we offer.</p>
<h3 id="editorial"><a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6021546">Editorial</a></h3>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>overly generic ads that contain vague phrases such as "Buy products here"</li>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>a display URL that does not accurately reflect the URL of the landing page, such as "google.com" taking users to "gmail.com"</li>

<h2 id="about-our-policies">About our policies</h2>
<p>Google Ads enables businesses of all sizes, from around the world, to promote a wide variety of products, services, applications, and websites on Google and across our network. We want to help you reach existing and potential customers and audiences. However, to help create a safe and positive experience for users, we listen to their feedback and concerns about the types of ads they see. We also regularly review changes in online trends and practices, industry norms, and regulations. And finally, in crafting our policies, we also think about our values and culture as a company, as well as operational, technical, and business considerations. As a result, we have created a set of policies that apply to all promotions on the Google Network.</p>
<p>Google requires that advertisers comply with all <a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6023676">applicable laws and regulations</a> and the Google policies described above. It's important that you familiarize yourself with and keep up to date on these requirements for the places where your business operates, as well as any other places your ads are showing. When we find content that violates these requirements, we may block it from appearing, and in cases of repeated or egregious violations, we may stop you from advertising with us.</p>
