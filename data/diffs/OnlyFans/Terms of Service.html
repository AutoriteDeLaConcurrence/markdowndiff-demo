<p><strong>What we are not responsible for:</strong> We will use reasonable care and skill in providing OnlyFans to you, but there are certain things which we are not responsible for, as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We do not authorize or approve Content on OnlyFans, and views expressed by Creators or Fans on OnlyFans do not necessarily represent our views.</li>
<li>We do not grant you any rights in relation to Content. Any such rights may only be granted to you by Creators.</li>
<li>Your Content may be viewed by individuals that recognise your identity. We will not in any way be responsible to you if you are identified from your Content.

</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Intellectual property rights – ownership and licenses:</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>1. You confirm that you own all intellectual property rights (examples of which are copyright and trademarks) in your Content or that you have obtained all necessary rights to your Content which are required to grant licenses in respect of your Content to us and to other Users. This includes any rights required to engage in the acts covered by sub-section<delete> 10(b)</delete><insert> **10(b)**</insert> below in any territory in which OnlyFans is accessible and, in particular, in the United States of America, the United Kingdom and the European Union. 2. You agree to grant us a license under all your Content to perform any act restricted by any intellectual property right (including copyright) in such Content, for any purpose reasonably related to the provision and operation of OnlyFans. Such acts include to reproduce, make available and communicate to the public, display, perform, distribute, translate, and create adaptations or derivative works of your Content, and otherwise deal in your Content. 3. The license which you grant to us under sub-section<delete> 10(b)</delete><insert> **10(b)**</insert> above is perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, assignable and transferable by us. This means that the license will continue even after your agreement with us ends and you stop using OnlyFans, that we do not have to pay you for the license, and that we can grant a sub-license of your Content to someone else or assign or transfer the license to someone else. This license will allow us, for example, to add stickers, text, and watermarks to your Content, to make your Content available to other Users of OnlyFans, as well as to use your Content for other normal operations of OnlyFans. We will never sell your Content to other platforms, though we may sell or transfer any license you grant to us in the Terms of Service in the event of a sale of our company or its assets to a third party. 4. Whilst we do not own your Content, you grant us the limited right to submit notifications of infringement (including of copyright or trademark) on your behalf to any third-party website or service that hosts or is otherwise dealing in infringing copies of your Content without your permission. Although we are not under any obligation to do so, we may at any time submit or withdraw any such notification to any third-party website or service where we consider it appropriate to do so. However, we do not and are under no obligation to police infringements of your Content. You agree that if we request, you will provide us with all consents and other information which we reasonably need to submit notifications of infringement on your behalf. Please see our [Complaints Policy](#complaints-policy) for how to make a complaint about infringement of intellectual property rights. 5. You waive any moral rights which you may have under any applicable law to object to derogatory treatment of any Content posted by you on OnlyFans. This waiver does not affect in any way your ownership of any intellectual property rights in your Content or the rights which you have to prevent your Content from being copied without your permission. The waiver is intended to allow us when dealing with your Content (as permitted by the license which you give us in section<delete> 10(b)</delete><insert> **10(b)**</insert> above) to add watermarks, stickers or text to your Content.</code></pre>

<strong>Twitter:</strong> Users have the facility to connect an active Twitter account to their OnlyFans account and to share certain Content in the form of OnlyFans posts to Twitter using the share feature. If you use this feature, you must fully comply with Twitter's terms of service from time to time in respect of any Content shared in this way.</li>
<li><strong>Linking to and from OnlyFans:</strong></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>1. Links to OnlyFans: * You may link to the OnlyFans homepage, provided you do so in a way that is fair and legal and does not damage our reputation or take advantage of it, but you must not establish a link in such a way as to suggest any form of association, approval, or endorsement on our part. * If you are a Creator, when promoting your Creator account you must comply with our Terms of Service and the terms of service of any other website where you place a link to or otherwise promote your Creator account. When promoting your Creator account, you must not impersonate OnlyFans or give the impression that your Creator account is being promoted by us if this is not the case. You must not promote your OnlyFans account by using Google Ads or any similar advertising platform or search engine advertising service. 2. Links from OnlyFans: If OnlyFans contains links to other sites and resources provided by third parties, these links are provided for your convenience only. Such links should not be interpreted as approval by us of those linked websites or information you may obtain from them. We have no control over the contents of those sites or resources and accept no responsibility for them or for any loss or damage that may arise from your use of them. If you decide to access any of the third-party websites linked to OnlyFans, you do so entirely at your own risk and subject to the terms and conditions of use for such websites.<insert> 3. Domain Names: In some instances, OnlyFans may allow Creators to register or use domain names that contain the OnlyFans trademark or a confusingly similar term. However, you will not register such a domain name, unless: * The domain name is registered by the Creator. * The domain name redirects to the Creator’s OnlyFans profile. Domain names containing the OnlyFans trademark or a confusingly similar term must not direct to any other website, including link aggregators. * The Creator obtains prior written permission from OnlyFans and signs a licensing agreement. If you would like to register a domain name containing the OnlyFans trademark or a confusingly similar term, please contact [support@onlyfans.com](mailto:support@onlyfans.com). Failing to comply with these provisions or the licensing agreement will be considered a violation of the licensing agreement and may result in OnlyFans filing a domain dispute against the registrant.</insert></code></pre>

<li><strong>Circumstances in which we may withhold Creator Earnings:</strong></li>

<pre><code>1. We may withhold all or any part of the Creator Earnings due to you but not yet paid out: 1. if we think that you have or may have seriously or repeatedly breached any part of the Terms of Service ; 2. if you attempt or threaten to breach any part of the Terms of Service in a way which we think has or could have serious consequences for us or another User (including actual or possible loss caused to us or another User) ; or 3. if we suspect that all or any part of the Creator Earnings result from unlawful<insert> or fraudulent</insert> activity, either by you or by the Fan who made the Fan Payment resulting in the Creator Earnings, for as long as is necessary to investigate the actual, threatened or suspected breach by you or the suspected unlawful activity (as applicable). If following our investigation, we conclude that (i) you have seriously or repeatedly breached any part of the Terms of Service ; (ii) you have attempted or threatened to breach any part of the Terms of Service in a way which has or could have serious consequences for us or another User (including actual or possible loss caused to us or another User), and/or (iii) the Creator Earnings result from unlawful<insert> or fraudulent</insert> activity, we may notify you that you have forfeited your Creator Earnings. 2.

<li><strong>Promoting Tax compliance and VAT:</strong></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>1. **General:** 1. We recommend that all Creators seek professional advice to ensure you are compliant with your local Tax and VAT rules, based on your individual circumstances. 2. By using OnlyFans as a Creator, you warrant (which means you make a legally enforceable promise) that you have reported and will report in the future the receipt of all payments made to you in connection with your use of OnlyFans to the relevant Tax authority in your jurisdiction, as required by law. 3. By using OnlyFans as a Creator you warrant (which means you make a legally enforceable promise) that you will at all times comply with all laws and regulations relating to Tax which apply to you. If, at any point whilst you have an OnlyFans account, any Tax non-compliance occurs in relation to you (including a failure by you to report earnings or the imposition on you of any penalty or interest relating to Tax) or if any litigation, enquiry, or investigation is commenced against you that is in connection with, or which may lead to, any occurrence of Tax non-compliance, you agree that you will: 1. notify us by email to [vat@onlyfans.com](mailto:vat@onlyfans.com) in writing within 7 days of the occurrence of the Tax non-compliance or the commencement of the litigation, enquiry or investigation (as applicable) ; and 2. promptly provide us by email to [vat@onlyfans.com](mailto:vat@onlyfans.com) with: 1. details of the steps which you are taking to address the occurrence of the Tax non-compliance and to prevent the same from happening again, together with any mitigating factors that you consider relevant ; and 2. such other information in relation to the occurrence of the Tax non-compliance as we may reasonably require. 4. For the avoidance of doubt, you are responsible for your own Tax affairs and<delete> OnlyFans is</delete><insert> we and our subsidiary companies (i) are</insert> not responsible<insert> for advising you on your Tax affairs and will not be liable in respect of any general information provided on OnlyFans</insert> or<insert> by [support@onlyfans.com](mailto:support@onlyfans.com) in respect of Tax, and (ii) will not be</insert> liable for any non-payment of Tax by Creators. 5. We reserve the right to close your OnlyFans account if we are notified of or become aware of any Tax non-compliance by you. 2. **UK VAT and UK established Creators:** 1. For the purposes of UK VAT only, Creators are treated as providing their services to OnlyFans, rather than to Fans directly. 2. If you are a Creator registered for UK VAT: 1. You will be treated, for VAT purposes, as charging OnlyFans your Creator Earnings (80% of all and any Fan Payments), together with UK VAT at the prevailing rate in force at the time of the Fan Payment ; 2. OnlyFans also agrees that, subject to the terms set out in this section of these Terms of Use for Creators, you can add UK VAT at the prevailing rate in force at the time of the referral payment to the amount of any referral payments payable to you under the [Referral Program Terms](#referral-program-terms)<delete> ("**Referral</delete><insert> (" **Referral</insert> Payments**"). 3. You agree to use the OnlyFans VAT invoice generator tool which can be found at: [https://onlyfans.com/my/banking/vat/create-document](https://onlyfans.com/my/banking/vat/create-document) to generate monthly VAT invoices, addressed to Fenix International Limited, in respect of your Creator Earnings (and Referral Payments, if any) for the relevant period together with the VAT on such Creator Earnings (and Referral Payments, if any) ; 4. The VAT element added to your Creator Earnings (and Referral Payments, if any) (the "VAT Amount") will be paid to you by<delete> us by</delete> way of a separate payment outside of your regular Creator Earnings, provided that you must have submitted to us copies of the following before payment of the VAT Amount will be made<delete> by us:</delete><insert> to you:</insert> 1. your VAT registration number by completing this form [https://onlyfans.com/my/banking/vat](https://onlyfans.com/my/banking/vat) ; 2. a valid VAT invoice generated and submitted using the OnlyFans VAT invoice generator tool and uploaded using [https://onlyfans.com/my/banking/vat/add-documents](https://onlyfans.com/my/banking/vat/add-documents) ; and 3. a VAT return made to HM Revenue &amp; Customs, including a value of taxable supplies equal to or greater than the aggregate value of your Creator Earnings (and Referral Payments, if any) for the relevant period. You can find the monthly earning details at [https://onlyfans.com/my/stats/earnings](https://onlyfans.com/my/stats/earnings) ; 3. You shall pay the VAT Amount which is paid to you<delete> by us</delete> directly to HM Revenue &amp;<delete> Customs ;</delete><insert> Customs.</insert> 4. If you need any further information or assistance on what is needed in order to receive the VAT Amount you can email [vat@onlyfans.com](mailto:vat@onlyfans.com). 5. More information on who is required to register for VAT in the UK, and the VAT position for Creators whose earnings are not above the earnings threshold or who are not VAT registered can be found at [https://onlyfans.com/help/3/120](https://onlyfans.com/help/3/120) and in the following guidance from HM Revenue &amp; Customs in the UK at [https://www.gov.uk/vat-registration/when-to-register](https://www.gov.uk/vat-registration/when-to-register). 6. You agree that you will keep copies of all VAT invoices and VAT returns in connection with your earnings from OnlyFans and you will provide us with copies of such documents within 14 days of our written request that you do so. For the avoidance of doubt, it is your obligation to comply with all provisions of VAT legislation and make, give, obtain, maintain and keep accurate, complete and up-to-date records, invoices, accounts and other documents required for the purposes of the VAT legislation. 7. If you are a Creator in the UK who is not required to register for UK VAT, then you should monitor the level of taxable sales that you make in the UK (including any Referral Payments) to ensure you have not exceeded the VAT registration threshold in the UK. It is your obligation, as a taxable person, to monitor whether you have exceeded the VAT registration threshold. 8. We do not monitor earnings that Creators receive from other income sources. However, we will monitor the annual earnings of UK Creators on our platform, and if you are not already VAT registered and your earnings exceed the VAT registration threshold, you will receive a notification from us asking you to register for VAT. If you receive such a VAT registration notification, you agree to register for VAT as soon as possible and to send your VAT registration number to us at [vat@onlyfans.com](mailto:vat@onlyfans.com), within 6 weeks of such notification. Failure to do so may result in your OnlyFans account being closed.</code></pre>
