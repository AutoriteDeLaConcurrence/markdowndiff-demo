<p><strong>What we are not responsible for:</strong> We will use reasonable care and skill in providing OnlyFans to you, but there are certain things which we are not responsible for, as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We do not authorize or approve Content on OnlyFans, and views expressed by Creators or Fans on OnlyFans do not necessarily represent our views.</li>
<li>We do not grant you any rights in relation to Content. Any such rights may only be granted to you by Creators.</li>
<li>Your Content may be viewed by individuals that recognise your identity. We will not in any way be responsible to you if you are identified from your Content.

</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Intellectual property rights – ownership and licenses:</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>1. You confirm that you own all intellectual property rights (examples of which are copyright and trademarks) in your Content or that you have obtained all necessary rights to your Content which are required to grant licenses in respect of your Content to us and to other Users. This includes any rights required to engage in the acts covered by sub-section<delete> 10(b)</delete><insert> **10(b)**</insert> below in any territory in which OnlyFans is accessible and, in particular, in the United States of America, the United Kingdom and the European Union. 2. You agree to grant us a license under all your Content to perform any act restricted by any intellectual property right (including copyright) in such Content, for any purpose reasonably related to the provision and operation of OnlyFans. Such acts include to reproduce, make available and communicate to the public, display, perform, distribute, translate, and create adaptations or derivative works of your Content, and otherwise deal in your Content. 3. The license which you grant to us under sub-section<delete> 10(b)</delete><insert> **10(b)**</insert> above is perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, assignable and transferable by us. This means that the license will continue even after your agreement with us ends and you stop using OnlyFans, that we do not have to pay you for the license, and that we can grant a sub-license of your Content to someone else or assign or transfer the license to someone else. This license will allow us, for example, to add stickers, text, and watermarks to your Content, to make your Content available to other Users of OnlyFans, as well as to use your Content for other normal operations of OnlyFans. We will never sell your Content to other platforms, though we may sell or transfer any license you grant to us in the Terms of Service in the event of a sale of our company or its assets to a third party. 4. Whilst we do not own your Content, you grant us the limited right to submit notifications of infringement (including of copyright or trademark) on your behalf to any third-party website or service that hosts or is otherwise dealing in infringing copies of your Content without your permission. Although we are not under any obligation to do so, we may at any time submit or withdraw any such notification to any third-party website or service where we consider it appropriate to do so. However, we do not and are under no obligation to police infringements of your Content. You agree that if we request, you will provide us with all consents and other information which we reasonably need to submit notifications of infringement on your behalf. Please see our [Complaints Policy](#complaints-policy) for how to make a complaint about infringement of intellectual property rights. 5. You waive any moral rights which you may have under any applicable law to object to derogatory treatment of any Content posted by you on OnlyFans. This waiver does not affect in any way your ownership of any intellectual property rights in your Content or the rights which you have to prevent your Content from being copied without your permission. The waiver is intended to allow us when dealing with your Content (as permitted by the license which you give us in section<delete> 10(b)</delete><insert> **10(b)**</insert> above) to add watermarks, stickers or text to your Content.</code></pre>

<strong>Twitter:</strong> Users have the facility to connect an active Twitter account to their OnlyFans account and to share certain Content in the form of OnlyFans posts to Twitter using the share feature. If you use this feature, you must fully comply with Twitter's terms of service from time to time in respect of any Content shared in this way.</li>
<li><strong>Linking to and from OnlyFans:</strong></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>1. Links to OnlyFans: * You may link to the OnlyFans homepage, provided you do so in a way that is fair and legal and does not damage our reputation or take advantage of it, but you must not establish a link in such a way as to suggest any form of association, approval, or endorsement on our part. * If you are a Creator, when promoting your Creator account you must comply with our Terms of Service and the terms of service of any other website where you place a link to or otherwise promote your Creator account. When promoting your Creator account, you must not impersonate OnlyFans or give the impression that your Creator account is being promoted by us if this is not the case. You must not promote your OnlyFans account by using Google Ads or any similar advertising platform or search engine advertising service. 2. Links from OnlyFans: If OnlyFans contains links to other sites and resources provided by third parties, these links are provided for your convenience only. Such links should not be interpreted as approval by us of those linked websites or information you may obtain from them. We have no control over the contents of those sites or resources and accept no responsibility for them or for any loss or damage that may arise from your use of them. If you decide to access any of the third-party websites linked to OnlyFans, you do so entirely at your own risk and subject to the terms and conditions of use for such websites.<insert> 3. Domain Names: In some instances, OnlyFans may allow Creators to register or use domain names that contain the OnlyFans trademark or a confusingly similar term. However, you will not register such a domain name, unless: * The domain name is registered by the Creator. * The domain name redirects to the Creator’s OnlyFans profile. Domain names containing the OnlyFans trademark or a confusingly similar term must not direct to any other website, including link aggregators. * The Creator obtains prior written permission from OnlyFans and signs a licensing agreement. If you would like to register a domain name containing the OnlyFans trademark or a confusingly similar term, please contact [support@onlyfans.com](mailto:support@onlyfans.com). Failing to comply with these provisions or the licensing agreement will be considered a violation of the licensing agreement and may result in OnlyFans filing a domain dispute against the registrant.</insert></code></pre>
