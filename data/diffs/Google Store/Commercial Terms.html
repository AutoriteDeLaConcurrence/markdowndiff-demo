If the payment method you provide cannot be verified, is invalid or is otherwise not acceptable, your order may be suspended or cancelled. You will need to resolve any problem we encounter in order to proceed with your order.</p><p diff:insert="" class="diff-inserted">Google reserves the right to reject all or part of an order and may refuse to ship Devices to you for reasons such as: (a) if we detect suspicious or fraudulent activity (including unauthorised reseller activity) in violation of these Terms; (b) if we do not currently deliver to the country you want to ship the Device to; (c) if you order more than the permitted maximum number of Devices; or (d) if your Device is out of stock.</p><p diff:delete="" class="diff-deleted">Please refer to <a href="https://support.google.com/store/?hl=en-GB">Google Store Support</a> to learn more about any support offered by Google in connection with your Device. The Google support team will only provide support if you are located in a supported country, as described in the <a href="https://support.google.com/store/answer/2462844?hl=en-GB">Country Availability</a> Page.</p>
<p diff:delete="" class="diff-deleted"><strong>Ordering, Conclusion of Contract and Payment</strong></p>
<p diff:delete="" class="diff-deleted">When you place an order for a Device on the Google Store, you permit Google to charge the credit card, debit card or other payment method you have chosen for your purchase in the total amount of your order (including any shipping charges and taxes).</p>
<p diff:delete="" class="diff-deleted">Google reserves the right to reject your order. For example, Google may reject your order if you do not live in a country from which Devices may be purchased via the or if you order more than the permitted maximum number of Devices.</p>
<p><delete>We</delete><insert>If your order is accepted by Google, we</insert> will send you<delete> without delay</delete> an email<delete> confirming receipt</delete><insert> (without delay) confirming: order acceptance ; details</insert> of your order<insert> ;</insert> and<delete> an order number that you should refer</delete><insert> how</insert> to<insert> follow-up</insert> if you have<delete> any follow-up queries.</delete><insert> questions.</insert> You should check and amend any errors before submitting your order to us. Your contract with Google becomes effective<delete> at the time</delete><insert> when we email</insert> you<delete> place</delete><insert> to confirm acceptance of</insert> your order, but is subject to the condition that Google thereafter sends a second email confirming your Device has been shipped. As mentioned in the<insert> paragraph immediately above this one and in the</insert> section on<delete> "Delivery"</delete><insert> “Delivery”</insert> below, there may be circumstances in which we cannot ship a Device to you. If your order contains more than one item, not all of which ship at the same time, the contract for those items that have not shipped will also be subject to the condition of our sending an email confirming shipment of the remaining items.</p>
<p diff:insert="" class="diff-inserted">6. <strong>Payment for Subscription Services</strong></p><p diff:insert="" class="diff-inserted">Continuous Subscriptions. When you purchase any of our Subscription Services, you agree that (1) Google is authorised to charge you a monthly or annual subscription service fee depending on the billing cycle you choose for as long as your subscription continues, and (2) your subscription is continuous until you cancel it as set out in the <a href="https://support.google.com/store/answer/11264766">Cancellation Policy</a>, or until such Subscription Service is terminated. Your legal right of withdrawal in respect of Subscription Services is set out in paragraph 17 below.</p><p diff:insert="" class="diff-inserted">Billing. We automatically bill the payment method associated with your Google account on a monthly or annual basis (depending on the billing cycle you choose). Day one of your billing cycle is tied to the date you activate your Subscription Services by pairing them to Device(s). In the event you later decide to purchase additional Subscription Services (each, an “<strong>Add-On Service</strong>”), your payments for these Add-On Service will be added to your existing billing cycle. This means if you subscribe to an Add-On Service midway through a billing cycle we will prorate the payment for that billing cycle and add it onto the next payment due on your next subscription renewal date, in addition to any normal amount due for the Add-On Service. Thereafter, the full amount of the Add-On Service will be charged on your subscription renewal date.</p><p diff:insert="" class="diff-inserted">When you purchase a Subscription Service, you will initially be charged at the rate applicable at the time of your agreement to subscribe. If the price of the subscription increases later, Google will notify you by email in advance. The increase will apply to the next payment due from you after the notice, provided that you have been given at least 10 days' prior notice before the charge is made. If you are given less than 10 days' prior notice, the price increase will not apply until the payment after the next payment due. If you do not wish to pay the increased price for a subscription, you may cancel the Subscription Service in accordance with the procedure described in the Cancellations section of these Terms, and you will not be charged further amounts for the Subscription Service, provided you have notified us before the end of the current billing period.</p><p diff:insert="" class="diff-inserted">Cancellations and Refunds. Please see this <a href="https://support.google.com/store/answer/11264766">Cancellation Policy</a> for how to cancel product Subscription Services.</p><p diff:insert="" class="diff-inserted">No Cost Trials. We may offer trials of our Subscription Services for limited periods of time without asking you to pay, after which you will be charged until you cancel your subscription. To avoid being charged, you must cancel before the end of the trial period. Once you cancel your trial, you will immediately lose access to any subscription privileges unless otherwise specified. Access to such trial periods may be limited to a certain number of trials for each user during a given period, or subject to other restrictions as set out in the terms applicable to the relevant trial.</p><p diff:insert="" class="diff-inserted">Pre-paid Subscription Services. We may offer Devices that include pre-paid Subscription Services, either included in the purchase price or as multiple products sold together at a discount. Pre-paid Subscription Services may not be used with Devices other than the Device with which those pre-paid Subscription Services were purchased. If you purchase such Devices, and subject to these Terms, the pre-paid Subscription Services will begin on the date you pair your Device with your Google account and end on the date noted in your Google account following activation. Except as set out in this paragraph, pre-paid Subscription Services are subject to the same terms and conditions as other Subscription Services.</p><p><insert>7.</insert> <strong> Prices and Taxes </strong></p>

<p diff:delete="" class="diff-deleted"><strong>Promotions and Promotional Balance</strong></p>
<p diff:delete="" diff:move="" class="diff-moved diff-deleted">Google may offer promotions or promotional prices for the sale of Devices. If so, any terms applicable to such promotional offers or prices will govern.</p>
<p diff:delete="" class="diff-deleted">Google Store promotional balance (“<strong>Promotional Balance</strong>") is issued by Google Commerce Limited. You must be at least 18 years of age and a resident of the United Kingdom in order to redeem a promotional code. To redeem Promotional Balance, you will need to have or create a Google Payments account. Unused Promotional Balance expires on the date specified at the time the Promotional Balance is provided, unless that date is extended in accordance with these terms. Google does not impose any fee on your use or maintenance of the Promotional Balance.</p>
<p diff:delete="" class="diff-deleted">Your Promotional Balance is an offer of a discount off purchase price, and has no cash value. It may be used for eligible purchases on the Store only, and may not be used on other Google websites or third-party websites. Your Promotional Balance is separate from any prepaid balance you may have on the Store, and may not be transferred to other users or withdrawn for cash. Your Google Payments account may display your Promotional Balance with other prepaid balances to show you the total value that can be purchased, for informational purposes only.</p>
<p diff:delete="" class="diff-deleted">Promotional Balance will be applied to your purchase amount prior to any available prepaid balance or other forms of payment, and any unspent Promotional Balance will be reapplied to your account. In the event you receive a refund of a purchase made with Promotional Balance, any refunded amount will be reapplied to your account for future use under these same terms. In the event a refund is provided for an expired Promotional Balance, Google may extend the expiration date, unless prohibited by law.</p>
<p diff:delete="" class="diff-deleted">If you close your Google Payments account, or Google chooses to no longer offer Google Payments or the Store, any remaining Promotional Balance associated will be forfeited. Google and its third party partners (if applicable) are not liable for lost or stolen promotional codes, or for expired promotional codes that are not redeemed within the redemption period.</p>
