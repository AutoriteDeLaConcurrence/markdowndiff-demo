<h4 id="description" diff:delete="" class="diff-deleted"><strong>Description</strong></h4>
<p>Participants on the Magnite platforms—i.e., the buyers and sellers that transact over our platforms, as well as the<delete> publishers,</delete><insert> sellers,</insert> advertisers, and advertising agencies that ultimately sell inventory or place ads using our platforms—all share an interest in ensuring the quality of ads served. These Ad Quality Guidelines (these “Guidelines”) describe our ad quality standards and provide guidance on the content and behavior of ads permitted through our platforms. Please review these Guidelines carefully. Magnite may, at its discretion, update these Guidelines at any time—it is your responsibility to ensure that you adhere to these Guidelines, including any updates hereto. If you have any questions about these Guidelines, please contact your Magnite account manager.</p>
<p diff:insert="" class="diff-inserted">Application</p><h4 id="application" diff:delete="" class="diff-deleted"><strong>Application</strong></h4>
<p>These Guidelines are not an exhaustive list of prohibitions, but rather represent platform principles – Magnite reserves the right to reject, suspend, or remove from its platforms any ad in its sole discretion, regardless of whether a basis for removal is listed here. These Guidelines do not limit Magnite’s discretion in any way.</p>
<p>Ads that do not meet the standards set forth in these Guidelines may be subject to, at Magnite’s discretion, platform-wide blocks, and buyers providing such ads may also be prohibited from purchasing ad inventory on the Magnite platforms. Buyers that repeatedly violate these Guidelines may have their platform access restricted. Buyers that purchase or place ads on behalf of their own affiliates or customers must ensure that the ads they purchase or place comply with these Guidelines.</p>
<p>Magnite maintains the<delete> right</delete><insert> right,</insert> but not the<delete> obligation</delete><insert> obligation,</insert> to review and approve all ads prior to the delivery to the inventory and to monitor the inventory for ad quality. Ultimately, though, it<insert> is</insert> the responsibility of each buyer (including the end advertisers or agencies that purchase through any individual buyer) to ensure compliance with these Guidelines.</p>

<ul>
<li>Your use of Magnite’s services, and every ad placed in connection with those services, must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and self-regulatory group guidelines in any relevant jurisdiction, including<delete> (but</delete><insert> but</insert> not limited<delete> to)</delete><insert> to..</insert> all laws, rules, and regulations that relate to the placement of ads through online behavioral advertising and to the delivery of ads to children ; the current Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) Code of Conduct, including the NAI Viewed Content Advertising guidance ; the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”)’s Self-Regulatory Principles (as updated from time to time, the “DAA<delete> Principles</delete><insert> Principles)</insert> ; the Interactive Advertising Bureau (“IAB”) Europe EU Framework for Online Behavioral Advertising ; the Australian Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“ADAA”) Best Practice Guideline for Online Behavioural Advertising ; and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (“APEC”) Privacy Framework, regardless of your membership status with any of these organizations.</li>
<li>All ads placed through the Magnite platforms must comply with the Ad Standards and Creative Guidelines set out by the Internet Advertising Bureau at <a href="http://www.iab.com/guidelines/iab-standard-ad-unit-portfolio/"> http://www.iab.com/guidelines/iab-standard-ad-unit-portfolio/ </a> unless otherwise authorized. Ads must also comply with the <a href="https://www.betterads.org/standards/"> Better Ads Standards </a> and not engage in any of the “least preferred ad experiences” as identified by the Coalition for Better Ads.</li>
<li>Buyers must provide consumers with comprehensible notice of their privacy practices, including, where appropriate, enhanced notice of behavioral targeting through mechanisms such as the Digital Advertising Alliance’s “AdChoices” icon. Advertisers that engage in behavioral advertising must also provide consumers with the ability to opt out of such targeted advertising. Buyers must respect all user opt out and/or privacy signals.</li>

This restriction includes app-store redirects on mobile devices.</li>
<li>In-banner video and VAST content may not run in traditional display formats. Without limitation, this means that if you purchase a display impression, you may not serve a VAST video ad as part of that banner ad.</li>
<li>Ads may not auto-refresh. Only one ad creative may be served per impression purchased.</li>
<li>Ads may not<delete> pop up</delete><insert> include pop-up</insert> windows, JavaScript dialogs, or other features that obscure content.</li>

<li>Ads may not falsify any user interaction, such as faking clicks.</li>
<li>Ads may not send an SMS message, or initiate a charge, without explicitly notifying a user and requiring a tap or other intentional action. Click-to-call or click-to-SMS ads must clearly indicate that clicking the ad will initiate the call or SMS message. Conventions such as a phone number that looks like a hyperlink are acceptable<delete> notification.</delete><insert> notifications.</insert>
</li>
<li>Video ads must not loop or<delete> repeat,</delete><insert> repeat</insert> unless triggered by affirmative action by the end user.</li>

<p><em>LANDING PAGE BEHAVIOR:</em></p>

<h4 id="bid-response-requirements" diff:delete="" class="diff-deleted"><strong>Bid Response Requirements</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>When bidding on inventory, every advertiser appearing in an individual ad must be declared in the bid response. On the Magnite<delete> Omni</delete><insert> DV+</insert> Platform, buyers should pass a URL or domain designating either the advertiser’s site or landing page of the campaign. On the Magnite CTV Platform, buyers should pass only the domain representing the actual advertiser’s site, which may not be the clickthrough URL. <span diff:delete-formatting="" old-formatting="strong" class="tooltipped diff-deleted-formatting" aria-label="Previous formatting : strong">Bid responses may not list an “advertiser” that is actually an ad network or other entity that is serving arbitrary creatives, without declaring the individual advertisers actually appearing in ads that are served.</span>
</li>
<li>When bidding on inventory, bid responses must include creative IDs, advertiser URLs or domains (adomain) as described above, and all fields designated as mandatory in the Open RTB specification.</li>
<li>All ads served with the same creative ID must be for the same advertiser(s). Buyers may not use a single creative ID for multiple materially distinct ads—the creative ID must be representative of the advertiser that appears in the actual creative. Notwithstanding the above, on the Magnite<delete> Omni</delete><insert> DV+</insert> Platform, A/B testing of different creative treatments for the same advertiser within the same creative ID is allowed, as is “dynamic creative optimization” and testing of slightly different retargeting offers for the same advertiser.</li>
<li>Buyers must comply with restrictions on creative content and formats that are described in bid requests, such as Open RTB’s imp.banner.battr, imp.video.battr, badv, etc.</li>
<li>Bid responses for linear video, including companion units, must respect <em>all</em> limitations and flags communicated in the bid request. This includes limitations both in fields required by the Open RTB specification, such as minduration and maxduration, and those that may be communicated in fields optional in that specification, such as battr.</li>
<li>Buyers must declare <em>all</em> advertisers in ads that include more than one brand or advertiser.</li>
<li>Buyers may not resell bid requests received from the Magnite platforms onto another SSP or exchange, including back into the Magnite exchanges through a direct or indirect seller integration, without the prior express written permission of Magnite.</li>
</ul>
<p diff:insert="" class="diff-inserted">POLITICAL ADVERTISING</p><h4 id="political-advertising" diff:delete="" class="diff-deleted"><strong>POLITICAL ADVERTISING</strong></h4>
<p>Buyers must comply with all applicable federal and state laws regarding political advertising, including obligations with respect to ensuring required disclosures regarding the source of political advertisements and maintaining certain archives.</p>
<p>All buyers purchasing inventory for the display of political ads through the Magnite platforms will be obligated to include a DAA Political Ad or similar icon within those advertisements, which link to information regarding the political advertiser’s name, contact information, contribution records, and other disclosures required by applicable state law.</p>
<p>Political ads and political ad landing pages must not include or contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content promoting candidates for state or local elections and/or ballot measures in the following states: New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Nevada, and Washington.</li>
<li>Content promoting candidates for state or local elections and/or ballot measures in California, other than ads that are: (a) a graphic, image, animated graphic, or animated image that the online platform hosting the advertisement allows to hyperlink to an internet website, or (b) all video or all audio.</li>
<li>Any political advertisement in the United States if the advertiser is not located in the United States. Any political advertisement in any other jurisdiction if the advertiser is not located in that jurisdiction.</li>
</ul>
<p diff:insert="" class="diff-inserted">Kid’s Sites</p><h4 id="childrens-sites" diff:delete="" class="diff-deleted"><strong>Children’s Sites</strong></h4>
<p>Sellers may designate some of their media as directed to or otherwise frequented by minors in one of two regulatory fields transmitted in our bid requests: coppa and regs.ext.s22580. Please note that the regs.coppa field is set by the<delete> publisher</delete><insert> seller</insert> to note that an impression falls within the scope of the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.</p>
<p>Similarly, the regs.ext.s22580 field is set by the<delete> publisher</delete><insert> seller</insert> to note that an impression falls within the scope of California Business and Professions Code Section 22580.

<p>If a seller raises a concern about an undesired and/or malicious ad serving on their media, or a buyer raises a concern about an ad serving against undesired and/or malicious content, they can contact Magnite via <a href="mailto:globalsupport@magnite.com"> globalsupport@magnite.com </a> . Once notified, Magnite will initiate an investigation into the complaint within 24 hours and make<insert> a</insert> commercially reasonable effort to take down the ad, either by internal actions or by contacting the applicable DSP, if necessary.</p>
