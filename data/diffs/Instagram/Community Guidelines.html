<p><em><strong>COVID-19: Community Guidelines Updates and Protections:</strong> As people around the world confront this unprecedented public health emergency, we want to make sure that our Community Guidelines protect people from harmful content and new types of abuse related to COVID-19. We’re working to remove content that has the potential to contribute to real-world harm, including through our policies prohibiting coordination of harm, sale of medical masks and related goods, hate speech, bullying and harassment and misinformation that contributes to the risk of imminent violence or physical harm. To learn more about our policies on COVID-19 and vaccines, <a href="https://help.instagram.com/697825587576762">see here.</a></em></p>
<p>The Short</p>
<p>We want Instagram to continue to be an authentic and <delete>a</delete> safe place for inspiration and expression. Help us foster this community. <delete>Only post</delete> <insert>Post only</insert> your own photos and videos and always follow the law. Respect everyone on Instagram, <delete>don't</delete> <insert>don’t</insert> spam people or post nudity.</p>
<p>The Long</p>
<p>Instagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, <delete>ages</delete> <insert>ages,</insert> and beliefs. <delete>We've</delete> <insert>We’ve</insert> spent a lot of time thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.</p>
<p>We created the Community Guidelines so <delete>that</delete> you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By using Instagram, you agree to these guidelines and our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/legal/terms">Terms of Use</a> . <delete>We're</delete> <insert>We’re</insert> committed to these guidelines and we hope you are too. Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, <a href="https://help.instagram.com/366993040048856">disabled accounts</a> <insert>,</insert> or other restrictions.</p>
<p>In some cases, we allow content for public awareness <delete>that</delete> <insert>which</insert> would otherwise go against our Community Guidelines – if it is newsworthy and in the public interest. We <delete>only</delete> do this <insert>only</insert> after weighing the public interest value against the risk of harm and we look to international human rights standards to make these judgments.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Share only photos and videos that <delete>you've</delete> <insert>you’ve</insert> taken or have the right to share.</strong></p>
<p>As always, you own the content <delete>that</delete> you post on Instagram. Remember to post authentic content, and <delete>don't</delete> <insert>don’t</insert> post anything <delete>you've</delete> <insert>you’ve</insert> copied or collected from the Internet that you <delete>don't</delete> <insert>don’t</insert> have the right to post.

<p><strong>Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.</strong></p>
<p>We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow <a href="https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcommunitystandards%2Fadult_nudity_sexual_activity&amp;h=removed">nudity</a> on Instagram. This includes photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos in the context of breastfeeding, birth giving and after-birth moments, health-related situations (for example, post-mastectomy, breast cancer awareness or gender confirmation surgery) or an act of protest are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings and sculptures is <delete>OK</delete> <insert>OK,</insert> too.</p>
<p>People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we may remove images that show <span href="https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcommunitystandards%2Fchild_nudity_sexual_exploitation&amp;h=removed" diff:delete-formatting="" old-formatting="a" class="tooltipped diff-deleted-formatting" aria-label="Previous formatting : a"><a href="https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcommunitystandards%2Fchild_nudity_sexual_exploitation&amp;h=removed" diff:insert-formatting="" class="diff-no-format-changed">nude or</a></span> <a href="https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcommunitystandards%2Fchild_nudity_sexual_exploitation&amp;h=removed"><delete>partially nude</delete></a> <a href="https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcommunitystandards%2Fchild_nudity_sexual_exploitation&amp;h=removed"><insert>partially-nude</insert></a> <span href="https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcommunitystandards%2Fchild_nudity_sexual_exploitation&amp;h=removed" diff:delete-formatting="" old-formatting="a" class="tooltipped diff-deleted-formatting" aria-label="Previous formatting : a"><a href="https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcommunitystandards%2Fchild_nudity_sexual_exploitation&amp;h=removed" diff:insert-formatting="" class="diff-no-format-changed">children</a></span> .

We also remove content that attempts to trade, co-ordinate the trade of, donate, gift, or ask for non-medical drugs, as well as content that either admits to personal use (unless in the recovery context) or coordinates or promotes the use of non-medical drugs. Instagram also prohibits the sale of live animals between private individuals, <delete>although</delete> <insert>though</insert> brick-and-mortar <delete>shops</delete> <insert>stores</insert> may offer these sales.

<p><strong>Respect other members of the Instagram community.</strong></p>
<p>We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains <a href="https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcommunitystandards%2Fcredible_violence&amp;h=removed">credible threats</a> or <a href="https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcommunitystandards%2Fhate_speech&amp;h=removed">hate speech</a>, content that targets private individuals to <a href="https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcommunitystandards%2Fbullying&amp;h=removed">degrade or shame them</a>, personal information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.</p>
<p>It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, <delete>disabilities</delete> <insert>disabilities,</insert> or diseases. When hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.</p>

This includes specific threats of physical harm as well as threats of theft, <delete>vandalism</delete> <insert>vandalism,</insert> and other financial harm. We carefully review reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.</strong></p>
<p>The Instagram community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult issues such as eating disorders, <delete>cutting</delete> <insert>cutting,</insert> or other kinds of self-injury come together to create awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding information in the <span href="https://help.instagram.com/" diff:delete-formatting="" old-formatting="a" class="tooltipped diff-deleted-formatting" aria-label="Previous formatting : a"><a href="https://help.instagram.com/" diff:insert-formatting="" class="diff-no-format-changed">Help</a></span> <a href="https://help.instagram.com/"><delete>Centre</delete></a> <a href="https://help.instagram.com/"><insert>Center</insert></a> so <delete>that</delete> people can get the help they need.</p>

We may also remove content identifying victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or <delete>humour.</delete> <insert>humor.</insert></p>

<li>
<p><strong>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, <a href="https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcommunitystandards%2Fgraphic_violence&amp;h=removed">graphic violence</a> to make sure <delete>that</delete> Instagram stays appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a warning about graphic violence. Sharing <a href="https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcommunitystandards%2Fcruel_insensitive&amp;h=removed">graphic images for sadistic pleasure</a> or to glorify violence is never allowed.</p>

<p>Help us keep the community strong:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our <a href="https://help.instagram.com/165828726894770">built-in reporting option</a> . We have a global team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that <delete>doesn't</delete> <insert>doesn’t</insert> meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you know doesn’t have an Instagram account, you can still <a href="https://help.instagram.com/contact/383679321740945">file a report</a> . When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible, such as links, <delete>usernames</delete> <insert>usernames,</insert> and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly. We may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our guidelines.</li>
<li>You may find content you <delete>don't</delete> <insert>don’t</insert> like, but <delete>doesn't</delete> <insert>doesn’t</insert> violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens, you can <a href="https://help.instagram.com/286340048138725">unfollow</a> or <a href="https://help.instagram.com/426700567389543/">block</a> the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a comment on one of your posts, you can <a href="https://help.instagram.com/289098941190483">delete that comment</a> .</li>
<li>Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the community. If one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting on the post and asking the person to take it down. If that <delete>doesn't</delete> <insert>doesn’t</insert> work, you can <a href="https://help.instagram.com/126382350847838">file a copyright report</a> .
