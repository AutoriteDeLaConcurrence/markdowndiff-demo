<p><em diff:insert-formatting="" class="diff-inserted-formatting"><strong diff:insert-formatting="" class="diff-inserted-formatting">COVID-19: Community Guidelines updates and protections:</strong> As people around the world confront this unprecedented public health emergency, we want to make sure that our Community Guidelines protect people from harmful content and new types of abuse related to COVID-19. We're working to remove content that has the potential to contribute to real-world harm, including through our policies prohibiting coordination of harm, sale of medical masks and related goods, hate speech, bullying and harassment, and misinformation that contributes to the risk of imminent violence or physical harm. As the situation evolves, we continue to look at content on the platform, assess speech trends and engage with experts, and will provide additional policy guidance when appropriate to keep the members of our community safe during this crisis.</em></p>
<p>The short</p>
<p>We want Instagram to continue to be an authentic and safe place for inspiration and expression. Help us foster this community. Post only your own photos and videos, and always follow the law. Respect everyone on Instagram; don't spam people or post nudity.</p>
<p>The long</p>
<p>Instagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages and beliefs. We've spent a lot of time thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.</p>
<p>We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By using Instagram, you agree to these guidelines and our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/legal/terms" diff:insert-formatting="">Terms of<delete> Use.</delete><insert> Use</insert></a><insert> .</insert> We're committed to these guidelines and we hope that you are too. Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, <a href="https://help.instagram.com/366993040048856" diff:insert-formatting="">disabled accounts</a> or other restrictions.</p>
<p>In some cases, we allow content for public awareness which would otherwise go against our Community Guidelines â€“ if it is newsworthy and in the public interest. We only do this after weighing the public interest value against the risk of harm and we look to international human rights standards to make these judgments.</p>
