<p><strong>The Instagram Service</strong></p>
<p>We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, <delete>technologies</delete> <insert>technologies,</insert> and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Offering <delete>personalised</delete> <insert>personalized</insert> opportunities to create, connect, communicate, <delete>discover</delete> <insert>discover,</insert> and share.</strong><br> People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences <delete>that</delete> you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, <delete>join</delete> <insert>join,</insert> and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, <delete>offers</delete> <insert>offers,</insert> and accounts <delete>that</delete> you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things <delete>that</delete> you and others do on and off Instagram.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fostering a positive, <delete>inclusive</delete> <insert>inclusive,</insert> and safe environment.</strong><br> We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and <delete>breaches</delete> <insert>violations</insert> of our Terms and <delete>Policies,</delete> <insert>policies,</insert> as well as harmful and deceptive <delete>behaviour.</delete> <insert>behavior.</insert> We use all the information we <delete>have – including</delete> <insert>have-including</insert> your <delete>information – to</delete> <insert>information-to</insert> try to keep our platform secure.

<li>
<strong>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community.</strong><br> <delete>Organising</delete> <insert>Organizing</insert> and <delete>analysing</delete> <insert>analyzing</insert> information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us <delete>personalise, protect</delete> <insert>personalize, protect,</insert> and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies <delete>such as</delete> <insert>like</insert> artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us <delete>to</delete> ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.</li>
<li>
<strong>Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products.</strong><br> Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, <delete>insights</delete> <insert>insights,</insert> and <delete>information – including</delete> <insert>information-including</insert> the information <delete>that</delete> we have about you (learn more in the <a href="https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?ref=igtos">Data Policy</a> ) in order to provide services that are better, <delete>safer</delete> <insert>safer,</insert> and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and <delete>have</delete> designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.</li>
<li>
<strong>Ensuring access to our Service.</strong><br> To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland <delete>Limited</delete> <insert>Limited,</insert> or their affiliates.</li>
<li>

<p diff:insert="" class="diff-inserted"><strong>How Our Service Is Funded</strong></p><p diff:delete="" class="diff-deleted"><strong>How our Service is funded</strong></p>
<p>Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and <delete>organisations</delete> <insert>organizations</insert> pay us to promote on and off the <a href="https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F195227921252400%3Fref%3Ddp&amp;h=removed">Meta Company Products</a> . We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.</p>
<p>We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We <delete>don't</delete> <insert>don’t</insert> sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things <delete>such as</delete> <insert>like</insert> their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.</p>
<p>We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We <delete>don't</delete> <insert>don’t</insert> share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work <a href="https://help.instagram.com/537518769659039">here</a> .</p>
