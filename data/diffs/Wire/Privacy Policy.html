<h3 id="1-our-privacy-commitment">1. Our Privacy Commitment</h3>
<p>Wire Swiss GmbH (“Wire” “we” “us”), as the responsible party within the meaning of data protection law, is committed to protecting your data. Wire does not rent or sell your data to third parties. Your data is also not used for targeted ads, or any other kind of profiling. This Privacy Policy informs you about how we process your data when you use the app offered by us and/or additional Wire products (together “Wire services”) and what rights you have as a data subject towards us. Unless the context indicates otherwise, any reference to “you”, “your” or “yourself” in this Privacy Policy includes the respective user of a team management functionality, the respective team admin and the respective team member of the Wire Services (as defined in our Terms of Use).</p>
<p>Our contact details are:</p>

<h3 id="2-conversation-content">2. Conversation content</h3>
<p>All conversation content is encrypted with strong encryption on the sender’s device and is only decrypted on the recipient’s device (also known as end-to-end encryption). Wire doesn’t hold the decryption keys, and our software contains no backdoor. Your conversations are yours — Wire has no access to them. You may delete the content of the conversations on your device specifically and generally at any time.</p>
<p>In addition, Wire also uses transport encryption to encrypt metadata.</p>
<p>Wire only temporarily stores encrypted messages on its servers and automatically deletes them after they are sent to the recipient. This is done to enable Wire to send messages to users who are not currently online as soon as they are back online.</p>
<p>The legal basis for the transmission and storage of conversations is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR (fulfilment of contract).</p>
<h3 id="3-logs-files">3. Logs files</h3>
<p>When you use Wire services, we may collect technical data, so-called “log files”, with each access. The collection of log files serves the purpose of providing Wire services. The legal basis for the collection is Art. 6 § 1 b) DS-GVO (fulfilment of contract).</p>
<p>Log files are kept for a maximum of 72 hours, and only to facilitate troubleshooting, improve the service and prevent misuse. The legal basis for storage is Art. 6 § 1 f) GDPR (legitimate interest). Our legitimate interest is the trouble-free provision of the Wire services.</p>

We store your profile information only for the duration of your account usage. If you delete your account, we will delete your profile information immediately. You can change or delete your profile data at any time. The legal basis for the processing of your profile data is Art. 6 § 1 b) GDPR (fulfilment of contract).</p>

In addition, other types of information related to the specific transaction may be collected, such as transaction amount and duration. The legal basis for the processing of the above-mentioned data is Art. 6 § 1 b) GDPR (fulfilment of contract), if we collect and store data for tax reasons, the legal basis is Art. 6 § 1 c) GDPR (fulfilment of a legal obligation). We delete this data within 6 months after our contract with you is terminated or after the expiry of any existing legal obligation to retain data.</p>

<p>If you have provided an e-mail address, Wire may send you e-mails to inform you of important changes (e.g. to confirm your e-mail address or to inform you that a new device has been added to your account). This is to help us provide you with a more secure experience with your account. The legal basis for the processing of this personal data is Art. 6 § 1 b) GDPR (fulfilment of contract).</p>
