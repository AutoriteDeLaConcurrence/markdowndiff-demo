<p diff:rename="h2" diff:delete-attr="id" class="diff-renamed tooltipped" aria-label="Previous tag : h2">2. General policies for Facebook Live</p>
<p><strong>Prohibited business practices</strong></p>
<p>Facebook Live must not be used to mislead users to think that specific footage is occurring in real time when it is not.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Misrepresenting footage of an event that occurred a year ago as currently happening</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Inaccurate location</strong></p>
<p>Facebook Live must not be used to mislead users to think that specific footage is happening in a particular locale when it is not.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Misrepresenting footage from a different country as footage from the United States</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pre-recorded content</strong></p>
<p>All pre-recorded content contained in a broadcast streamed to Facebook Live must be clearly marked as pre-recorded. For broadcasts that contain a mixture of live footage and pre-recorded footage, only the pre-recorded footage must be marked as pre-recorded.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Adding a graphic to mark specific footage as pre-recorded</p></li>
<li><p>Including a disclaimer in the video description or title that specific content is pre-recorded</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Looping or static content</strong></p>
<p>Facebook Live should not be used to broadcast looping videos, static images or poll-only videos.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Streaming a 20-minute clip that is continuously looped</p></li>
<li><p>A broadcast that is limited to a photo and has no other auditory or visual elements</p></li>
<li><p>A broadcast that only contains a poll</p></li>
</ul>
