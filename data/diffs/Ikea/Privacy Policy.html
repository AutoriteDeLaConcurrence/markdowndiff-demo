<h2 id="4-who-do-we-share-your-personal-data-with"><strong>4. Who do we share your personal data with?</strong></h2>
<p>We will never sell any of your personal data to a third party. However, in order for us to provide our services to you, we share your personal data with our trusted third party service providers or our group companies, as detailed below.

<h3 id="third-party-service-providers"><strong>Third party service providers</strong></h3>
<p><strong>To fulfil orders for products and services</strong></p>
<p>We work with a number of trusted service providers who carry out services on our behalf. When you purchase products and services from us, the services provided by these organisations includes delivery, product assembly and installation, waste removal and processing payments. We also work with a service provider to administer our gift card and account services. It is in our legitimate interests as a business to work with these service providers since we may not have the capabilities to provide these services ourselves. In each case, we will ensure that the service provider is only allowed to use your personal data in order to provide the services to us and for no other purpose.</p>
<p><strong>To prevent crime and comply with laws</strong></p>
<p>We share your financial information including your credit, debit card or other payment information with third parties to ensure that your payment is safe and that your details are not being used fraudulently. This data sharing enables us to conduct fraud analysis which ensures that genuine and accurate payment details are provided to us for any purchase. We may share your personal data with credit agencies if you are requesting credit.</p>
<p>There may be other scenarios where we are subject to a legal obligation to share or disclose your personal data, such as with law enforcement agencies or public authorities in order to prevent or detect crime or fulfil a legal requirement.</p>
<p>For the purposes of preventing crime, IKEA will use its legitimate interests to share certain information with third parties with which it has data processing agreements.

<li>Where you have requested a service which is fulfilled by one of our group companies which sit outside of the EEA; or</li>
<li>Where we work with a supplier which processes some of its personal data outside of the EEA.</li>
</ul>
<p>These countries may not have the same data protection laws as the EEA and so your personal data may not be subject to the same protections.
