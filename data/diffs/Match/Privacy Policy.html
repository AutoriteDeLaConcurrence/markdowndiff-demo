<p>This Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events and other services <delete>operated by Match (MIL).</delete> <insert>we operate under the brand MATCH.</insert> For simplicity, we refer to all of these as our “services” in this Privacy Policy. To make it extra clear, we’ve added links to this Privacy Policy on all applicable services.</p>
<p>Some services may require their own unique privacy policy. If a <delete>particular</delete> service has its own privacy policy, then that policy — not this Privacy Policy — applies.</p>
<h2 id="3-information-we-collect">3. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
<p>It goes without saying, we can’t help you develop meaningful connections without some information about you, such as basic profile details and the types of people you’d like to meet. We also collect information <delete>generated as you</delete> <insert>about your</insert> use <insert>of</insert> our <delete>services, for example</delete> <insert>services such as</insert> access logs, as well as information from third parties, like when you access our services through <delete>a</delete> <insert>your</insert> social media <delete>account.</delete> <insert>account or when you upload information from your social media account to complete your profile.</insert> If you want additional info, we go into more detail below.</p>
<p><strong><em>Information you give us</em></strong></p>
<p>You choose to give us certain information when using our services. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you create an account, you provide us with at least your login <delete>credentials,</delete> <insert>credentials or phone number,</insert> as well as some basic details necessary for the service to work, such as your gender and date of birth.</li>
<li>When you complete your profile, you can share with us additional information, such as details on your personality, lifestyle, interests and other details about you, as well as content such as photos and videos. To add certain content, like pictures or videos, you may allow us to access your camera or photo album. <delete>Some of the information you choose to provide us may be considered “special” or “sensitive” in certain jurisdictions, for example your racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientation and religious beliefs. By choosing to provide this information, you consent to our processing of that information.</delete>
</li>
<li>When you subscribe to a paid service or make a purchase directly from us (rather than through a platform such as iOS or Android), you provide us or our payment service provider with information, such as your debit or credit card number or other financial information.</li>
<li>When you participate in <delete>surveys or</delete> <insert>surveys,</insert> focus <delete>groups,</delete> <insert>groups or market studies,</insert> you give us your insights into our products and services, responses to our questions and testimonials.</li>
<li>When you choose to participate in our promotions, events or contests, we collect the information that you use to register or enter.</li>
<li diff:insert="" class="diff-inserted">If you contact our customer care team, we collect the information you give us during the interaction.</li><li diff:insert="" class="diff-inserted">If you share with us information about other people (for example, if you use contact details of a friend for a given feature), we process this information on your behalf in order to complete your request.</li><li diff:delete="" class="diff-deleted">If you contact our customer care team, we collect the information you give us during the interaction. Sometimes, we monitor or record these interactions for training purposes and to ensure a high quality of service.</li>

<li>Of course, we also process your chats with other users as well as the content you publish, as <delete>part of</delete> <insert>necessary for</insert> the operation of the services.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Information we receive from others</em></strong></p>
<p>In addition to the information you <insert>may</insert> provide us directly, we receive information about you from others, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><delete>Other</delete> Users</strong></li>
</ul>
<p diff:insert="" class="diff-inserted">Users may provide information about you as they use our services, for instance as they interact with you or if they submit a report involving you.</p><p diff:delete="" class="diff-deleted">Other users may provide information about you as they use our services.

<ul>
<li><strong>Social Media</strong></li>
</ul>
<p diff:insert="" class="diff-inserted">You may decide to share information with us through your social media account, for instance if you decide to create and log into your MATCH account via your social media or other account (e.g., Facebook, Google or Apple) or to upload onto our services information such as photos from one of your social media accounts (e.g., Facebook, Instagram…).</p><ul diff:insert="" class="diff-inserted">

<p>Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) have a “Do Not Track” (“ <strong>DNT</strong> ”) feature that tells a website that a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked. If a website that responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many businesses, including <delete>Match (MIL),</delete> <insert>MATCH,</insert> do not currently respond to DNT signals.</p>
