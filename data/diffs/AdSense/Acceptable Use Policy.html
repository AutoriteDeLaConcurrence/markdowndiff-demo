<p diff:insert="" class="diff-inserted"><strong>(March 23, 2022)</strong> Due to the war in Ukraine, we will pause monetization of content that exploits, dismisses, or condones the war.</p><p><strong>(March 10, 2022)</strong> Given the recent suspension of Google advertising systems in Russia, we’ll be pausing the creation of new Russian accounts on AdSense, AdMob, and Google Ad Manager. Additionally, we will pause ads on Google properties and networks globally for advertisers based in Russia.</p>
<p><strong>(March 3, 2022)</strong> Due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, we will be temporarily pausing ads from serving to users located in Russia.</p>
<p><strong>(February 26, 2022)</strong> In light of the war in Ukraine, we are pausing Google’s monetization of Russian Federation state-funded media. </p>
<p><strong>We will continue to actively monitor the situation and make adjustments as necessary.</strong></p>
<p>We are in the process of migrating and consolidating all of the Google Publisher Policies and Google Publisher Restrictions to the new <a href="https://support.google.com/publisherpolicies">Publisher Policies Help Center</a>. For now, you can still view all the policies in the <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/">AdMob</a>, <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/">AdSense</a>, and <a href="https://support.google.com/admanager/">Ad Manager</a> Help Centers, as well as the new Help Center. </p>
<p>When you monetize your content with Google ad code you are required to adhere to the following policies. Failure to comply with these policies may result in Google blocking ads from appearing against your content, or suspending or terminating your account.</p>
<p>These policies apply in addition to any other policies governing your use of Google publisher products.</p>
<p>Google helps to enable a free and open web by helping publishers monetize their content and advertisers reach prospective customers with useful, relevant products and services. Maintaining trust in the ads ecosystem requires setting limits on what we will monetize.</p>
<p>Google Publisher Policies are organized into the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#content">Content policies</a> </li>
<li>
<a href="#behavioral">Behavioral policies</a> </li>
<li><a href="#privacy">Privacy-related policies</a></li>
<li>
<a href="#standards">Requirements and other standards</a> </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="standard-contractual-clauses-sccs">Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)</h3>
<p>Google relies on Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for transfers of online advertising and measurement personal data out of Europe. For those <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/adsservices/">services where Google acts as a processor</a>, the <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/processorterms/">Google Ads Data Processing Terms</a> include, as necessary for the relevant data transfers, both the relevant SCCs issued by the European Commission (to help legitimize data transfers under the GDPR) and UK SCCs (to help legitimize data transfers under the GDPR as incorporated into UK law). Similarly, for <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/adsservices/">those services where Google acts as a controller</a>, the <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/controllerterms/">Google Ads Controller-Controller Data Protection Terms</a> include, as necessary for the relevant data transfers, both the relevant European Commission-issued SCCs and UK SCCs. </p>
<p>If partner processes personal data that originated in the European Economic Area, UK, or Switzerland and that is made available by Google in connection with partner's use of Google Ad Manager, then:</p>
<ul>
<li>partner must only use that personal data in a manner consistent with the consent provided by the data subject to whom it relates;</li>
<li>partner must provide a level of protection for that personal data that is at least equivalent to that required under the SCCs; and</li>
<li>if partner determines that it cannot comply with the above requirements, partner must notify Google in writing, and either cease processing the personal data or take reasonable and appropriate steps to remedy such non-compliance.</li>
</ul>
