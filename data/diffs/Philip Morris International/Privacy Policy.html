<p>We are a member of Philip Morris International. Our details (name, address, etc.) will have been given to you separately at the time of (or to confirm) the collection of information about you, for example, in a notice on an app or a website, or in an e-mail, containing a link to this notice.</p>

<li>
<em>PMI:</em> Philip Morris International, a leading international tobacco group. It is made up of a number of companies or “affiliates”.</li>
<li>
<em>PMI affiliates:</em> Each member of the Philip Morris International group of companies is a “PMI affiliate”. “We” (or “us” or “our”) refers to the PMI affiliate that first collected information about you.</li>
<li>
<em>PMI product</em>_:_ means a product of ours or of another PMI affiliate.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-we-collect-information-about-you">How do we collect information about you?</h2>
<p>We may collect information about you in various ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>You may provide us with information directly (e.g. filling in a form, or making a call to us).</li>
<li>We may collect information automatically (e.g. when you use a PMI app or website).</li>
<li>We may acquire information from third parties (e.g. publicly-available information on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter).</li>
</ul>
<p>In this notice, we refer to all the methods by which you are in contact with us as “<em>PMI</em> <em>touchpoints</em>”. PMI touchpoints include both physical (for example, retail outlets and events), and digital (for example, apps and websites).</p>
<p>Find Out More</p>
<p>We may collect information that you provide directly. Typically this will happen when you:</p>
<ul>
<li>sign up to be a member of our databases (this could be, for example, in person, via app, or online);</li>
<li>purchase PMI products or services at a retail outlet;</li>
<li>download, or use, a PMI digital touchpoint (e.g. an app or a website);</li>
<li>contact us through a touchpoint, or by e-mail, social media or telephone;</li>
<li>register a device with us;</li>
<li>subscribe to a PMI panel portal;</li>
<li>register to receive PMI press releases, e-mail alerts, or marketing communications;</li>
<li>participate in PMI surveys or (where permitted by law) PMI competitions or promotions; or</li>
<li>attend an event that a PMI affiliate has organised.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may collect information about you automatically. Typically this will happen when you:</p>
<ul>
<li>visit an outlet that sells PMI products (for example, by collecting your data at check-out, or through sensors at the outlet that connect with mobile technology);</li>
<li>attend an event that a PMI affiliate has organised (for example, through purchases at the event or through sensors at the event that connect with mobile technology);</li>
<li>communicate with us (for example, through a touchpoint; or social media platforms);</li>
<li>use PMI touchpoints (for example, through tracking mechanisms (such as cookies and web beacons/pixels) that you receive when you use the PMI touchpoint or get an e-mail from us);</li>
<li>use third party websites (for example, using technology similar to that described in the bullet above, that you receive when you visit a PMI touchpoint or get an e-mail from us); or</li>
<li>make public posts on social media platforms that we follow (for example, so that we can understand public opinion, or respond to requests concerning PMI products).</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned above, we may collect information about you automatically through the use of cookies and similar tracking technologies (such as web beacons/pixels) that you receive when you visit digital PMI touchpoints or get an e-mail from us. The specific cookies and other mechanisms used will depend on the PMI touchpoint in question. To learn about these mechanisms used on a touchpoint, including how you can accept or refuse cookies, please see the information made available on or through that touchpoint. These mechanisms may include <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">Google analytics cookies</a>.</p>
<p>Where permitted by law, we may acquire information about you from third parties. This may include information shared between PMI affiliates, publicly-available profile information (such as your preferences and interests) on third party social media sites (such as Facebook and Twitter), and marketing lists acquired from third party marketing agencies.</p>
<p>We may also collect information in other contexts made apparent to you at the time.</p>
<h2 id="what-information-about-you-do-we-collect">What information about you do we collect?</h2>
<p>We may collect various types of information about you:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>information necessary to fulfil your orders</p></li>
<li><p>information necessary to provide warranty services</p></li>
<li><p>information you give us in forms or surveys</p></li>
<li><p>information about your location, where you choose to share it with us on your mobile phone operating system</p></li>
<li><p>information about your visits to our outlets and events</p></li>
<li><p>information you give us in calls you make to call centers</p></li>
<li><p>information about your preferences and interests</p></li>
<li><p>information necessary to verify your age</p></li>
<li><p>information generated by your PMI electronic device (for example, <em>IQOS</em>)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Find Out More</p>
<p>Information that we collect from you directly will be apparent from the context in which you provide it. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>if you order a product from us through a touchpoint, you provide your name, contact, billing details, and the products you have chosen so that we can fulfil your order;</p></li>
<li><p>you may provide information on your product preferences and interests so that we can offer you products and services that will interest you;</p></li>
<li><p>if you make an appointment to see us (or someone supporting our products or services), we may collect your name and contact details;</p></li>
<li><p>we may collect information that enables us to verify your age, for example a copy of an identity document or your facial image.</p></li>
<li><p>if you have downloaded one of our apps, we may ask to use your location (even when the app is closed or not in use) for certain features. For example, the “find my IQOS” feature helps you find your device if lost, and it won’t work properly if you don’t share your location. We don’t keep the location data. It will be used only to allow these features and only if you agree to share this data by agreeing to the respective in-app disclosures.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Information that we collect automatically will generally concern:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>details of your visit or call (such as time, date, and duration);</p></li>
<li><p>recordings (where permitted) of your calls or visits to PMI touchpoints, which we may transcribe to text format;</p></li>
<li><p>in a sales outlet or at an event (including areas in the immediate vicinity), how frequently you visit, which areas you visit and for how long, and which purchases you make;</p></li>
<li><p>your use of digital PMI touchpoints (such as the pages you visit, the page from which you came, and the page to which you went when you left, search terms entered, or links clicked within the touchpoint, when you first open the touchpoint, for how long you use it, and how you interact with messages or advertisements we send you); we may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (such as pixels/web beacons) to do this;</p></li>
<li><p>your use of third party websites, where the information collected will be similar to that described in the bullet above (we may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (such as pixels/web beacons) to do this);</p></li>
<li><p>your mobile or desktop device and software (such as your IP address or unique device identifier (for example, mobile advertising identifier (MAID) or Android ID (SSAID)), location data (either derived from your IP address or if you choose to share your precise location with us for specified purposes, e.g. store locator), device brand and model, the display settings of your monitor, web browser type, operating system, (some of which may be used in “digital fingerprinting” (see for what purposes we use information about you, below)) and details of any cookies that we may have stored on your device);</p></li>
<li><p>your use of your PMI electronic device, if you choose to send this to us, which may include information about: (i) the device itself (holder serial number, charger serial number, firmware version, device errors); and (ii) use of the device (such as number of such as number of tobacco HEET sticks (for <em>IQOS</em>), number of cleans, battery use, puff count, and device life data (including cumulative values, and timestamps, for each of the foregoing)); and</p></li>
<li><p>if you return your PMI electronic device to us, or bring it to one of our stores, because it’s faulty, and choose to share with us the data it holds (as above), we may extract that data from the device.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Information that we collect from third parties will generally consist of publicly-available profile information (such as your preferences and interests), for example from public social media posts.</p>
<h2 id="for-what-purposes-do-we-use-information-about-you-and-on-what-legal-basis">For what purposes do we use information about you, and on what legal basis?</h2>
<p>In this section, we describe the purposes for which we use personal information. However, this is a global notice, and where the laws of a country restrict or prohibit certain activities described in this notice, we will not use information about you for those purposes in that country.</p>
<p>Subject to the above, we use information about you for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To comply with regulatory obligations, such as verifying your age and status as a user of our products</p></li>
<li><p>To sell our products to you, including fulfilling your orders, processing your payments</p></li>
<li><p>To provide sales-related services to you, including dealing with your inquiries and requests, and providing warranty and support services</p></li>
<li><p>To market our products (where permitted by law), including administering loyalty programs, product improvement, market research, developing marketing strategies, administering marketing campaigns, and customizing your experiences at outlets that sell PMI products and at events</p></li>
<li><p>To understand whether you are still engaged with our marketing and whether you wish to continue to receive it</p></li>
<li><p>For us or our business partners to inform you of potential opportunities to get involved in marketing or promoting PMI products</p></li>
<li><p>To support all the above, including administering your accounts, enabling you to use PMI touchpoints, corresponding with you, managing your appointments with us or with someone supporting our products or services (for example, regarding a new product, or after-sales service), customizing your experiences of PMI touchpoints, fraud prevention (for example in the context of our promotions, competitions and surveys, to ensure that they are not taken more than once by the same person), and administration and troubleshooting</p></li>
<li><p>For business analytics, statistical or scientific purposes, including improving PMI products, outlets and events, and the information that we (or our affiliates) provide to our customers</p></li>
<li><p>For other purposes that we notify you of, or will be clear from the context, at the point information about you is first collected</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The legal basis for our use of information about you is one of the following (which we explain in more detail in the “find out more” section):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject;</p></li>
<li><p>the performance of a contract to which you are a party;</p></li>
<li><p>a legitimate business interest that is not overridden by interests you have to protect the information;</p></li>
<li><p>where none of the above applies, or where law requires it, your consent (which we will ask for before we process the information).</p></li>

<h2 id="how-do-we-protect-information-about-you">How do we protect information about you?</h2>
<p>We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal information that we hold from unauthorised disclosure, use, alteration or destruction. Where appropriate, we use encryption and other technologies that can assist in securing the information you provide. We also require our service providers to comply with strict data privacy and security requirements.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-will-information-about-you-be-kept">How long will information about you be kept?</h2>
<p>We will retain information about you for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes for which the information was collected. After that, we will delete it. The period will vary depending on the purposes for which the information was collected. Note that in some circumstances, you have the right to request us to delete the information. Also, we are sometimes legally obliged to retain the information, for example, for tax and accounting purposes.</p>
<p>Find Out More</p>
<p>Typically, we retain data based on the criteria described in the table below:</p>
<p>| | | | --- | --- |How long will information about you be kept? | <strong>Type</strong> | <strong><strong>Explanation/typical retention criteria</strong></strong> | | * marketing to you (including marketing communications) (if you use digital touchpoints and are contactable) | Most of the information in your marketing profile is kept for the duration of our marketing relationship with you; for example, while you continue to use digital touchpoints, or respond to our communications. However, some elements of your marketing profile, such as records of how we interact with you, naturally go out of date after a period of time, so we delete them automatically after defined periods (typically 3 years) as appropriate for the purpose for which we collected them. | | * marketing to you (including marketing communications) (if you are no longer in contact with us) | This scenario is the same as the above, but if we don’t have any contact with you for a long period (typically 2 years), we will stop sending you marketing communications and delete your history of responses to them. This will happen, for example, if you never click through to an invitation to an event, log on to a digital touchpoint, or contact customer care, during that time. The reason is that in these circumstances, we assume you would prefer not to receive the communications. | | * marketing to you (including marketing communications) (if you are not contactable) | If you have registered to receive marketing communications, but the information you give us to contact you doesn’t work, we will retain your details for a period of typically only 6 months to allow you to return and correct it. | | * marketing to you (including marketing communications) (incomplete registrations) | If you commence registering yourself in a database, but do not complete the process (for example, if you don’t complete the age verification process, or you don’t accept the touchpoint’s terms of use), we will retain your details for only 6 months to allow you to return and complete the process. | | * market research | If you are not registered with us for other purposes (e.g. marketing communications, warranty, customer care), and we use publicly available information about you in order to understand the market or your preferences, we will retain the information about you for a short period in order to perform the particular item of market research. | | * purchases and warranty | If you purchase goods, we will retain details of this for so long as required to complete the sale, and to comply with any legal obligations (for example, for tax and accounting record-keeping purposes). If you also register for a warranty for a device, we will retain details of this for so long as relevant to the warranty. | | * customer care | If you contact customer care, we will make a record of the matter (including details of your enquiry and our response) and retain it while it remains relevant to our relationship, for example if you need us to replace a device under warranty, or if your recent enquiries are relevant. Temporary records (for example, an automated recording of a telephone call in which you ask us to direct you to a retail outlet) may be relevant only until more permanent records are made, and will be retained only temporarily. | | * system audit logs | System audit logs are retained typically for a period of only a few months. | | * business analytics | Business analytics data is typically collected automatically when you use PMI touchpoints and anonymised/aggregated shortly afterwards. |</p>
