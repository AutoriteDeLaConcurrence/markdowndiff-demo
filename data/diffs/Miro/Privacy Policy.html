Please note that this Policy applies where we are processing personal information on our own behalf. If you have been given access to our Services by another company or organization (e.g., your employer), or are otherwise using our Services on behalf of another company or organization, then we may be processing your information on behalf of that company or organization. In those circumstances, your access and use of the Services is subject to the agreement we have entered with that company or organization (the “<strong>Customer Agreement</strong>”) and the organization that entered into the Customer Agreement (“<strong>Customer</strong>”) controls and is responsible for the processing of your information. This Policy does not apply to information that we process on behalf of our Customers and if you have any questions about specific settings and privacy practices, please contact the administrator for your Miro account. In addition, this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party applications or software that integrate with the Services (“<strong>Third Party Services</strong>”), or any other third party products, services or businesses.

You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of all PII that you submit to us. Inaccurate information may affect your experience when using the Services and/or our ability to contact you as described in this Policy.

Non-personally identifiable information is not treated as PII unless we combine it with or link it to PII that you give to us.

<h4 id="disclosure-with-your-consent">Disclosure With Your Consent</h4>
<p>Where we are processing your information on behalf of a Customer, the Customer determines their own policies and practices for the sharing and disclosure of your information and Miro does not control how a Customer or any other third parties choose to share or disclose information. Where we are processing your information on our own behalf, we may disclose your information with your consent, which we may obtain in a number of ways, including:</p>
<p>• In writing;</p>
<p>• Verbally;</p>
<p>• Online, by clicking on a link or button;</p>
<p>• Other mechanism.</p>
<p>Our Services permit you to submit information which may be displayed to other authorized users in the same or different Customer Account. The sharing and other controls applied to such information may be determined by you, other users and/or an administrator of your Account.</p>
<h4 id="disclosure-without-your-consent">Disclosure Without Your Consent</h4>
<p>In general, we may disclose your information without your consent to disclosure when we reasonably believe disclosure is appropriate in order to:</p>
<p>• Comply with the law (e.g., lawful subpoena or court order);</p>
<p>• Cooperate with or report to law enforcement agencies in investigations that involve users who use our Service Offerings for activities that are or seem illegal or illegitimate activities;</p>
<p>• Enforce or apply agreements for our Service Offerings; or</p>
<p>• Protect our rights or property or that of our affiliates, including respective officers, directors, employees, agents, third party content providers, suppliers, sponsors, or licensors (e.g., to address allegations about fraudulent or unlawful activity related to a Miro account).</p>
<p>• In connection with a merger, acquisition, public offering, sale of company assets, insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, subject to standard confidentiality requirements.</p>
<p>• To defend Miro and our affiliates, licensors, officers, agents and representatives from legal claims and processes brought to us by third parties (including takedown notices);</p>
<p>• Use or disclose aggregated or de-identified data in our sole discretion.</p>
<p>We may share your information with third parties as necessary to provide Services to you or to support the technical operation and/or maintenance of our Services, including third party application that you may engage within the Services. We may also share information with our affiliates, agents, outside vendors or service providers to perform functions on our behalf (such as cloud storage providers, analytics services, marketing and advertising services and external consultants and professional advisers). When a third party acts solely on our behalf and otherwise as applicable, we use reasonable commercial efforts to require that party to follow the privacy practices stated in this Policy or have complementary privacy protections to protect your information. We do not share your information with unaffiliated third parties except as permitted to do so in this Policy.</p>
<h3 id="how-we-protect-information">How We Protect Information</h3>
<p>We use industry standard protocols and technology to protect your registered user information and personal data in order to guard and encrypt data for transmission in a format that prevents data theft by unauthorized third parties, including internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices, security measures, and physical security measures. However, please take into account that the Internet and email transmissions are not secure or error free communication means. We also urge you to take additional steps on your own to safeguard and maintain the integrity of your information. For example, you should never share your Account or login information with other people and be sure to sign off when finished using a shared or public computer. We urge you to be aware that if you use or access our Services through a third party computer network (e.g., internet café, library) or other potentially non-secure internet connection, such use is not recommended and is solely at your own risk. It is your responsibility to check beforehand on the privacy and/or security policy of your network prior to accessing the Services. We are not responsible for your handling, sharing, re-sharing and/or distribution of your information except as set forth in the Policy.</p>

<h4 id="privacy-shield">Privacy Shield</h4>
<p>Miro complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and United Kingdom, as applicable, to the United States. Miro has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</a>. Miro remains liable if it fails to meet its obligations under the Privacy Shield and is responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. In addition, when Miro receives personal information subject to the Privacy Shield Principles and subsequently transfers such information to a third-party service provider acting as an agent on Miro’s behalf, Miro remains liable if the agent processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield and we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Miro commits to resolve complaints about our collection and use of your personal information. Individuals in the European Union and United Kingdom with inquiries or complaints regarding our processing of personal information under the Privacy Shield should first contact our Data Protection Officer by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@miro.com">privacy@miro.com</a>. We will respond to your complaint within 45 days of receipt. Miro has further committed to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) as our independent recourse mechanism with regard to unresolved Privacy Shield complaints. If you are unsatisfied with the response you have received from us, or your complaint remains unresolved, you can contact your local DPA and they will investigate your complaint free of charge. You may also refer your complaint to the U.S. Department of Commerce or FTC for further investigation. In certain circumstances, you may elect to arbitrate unresolved complaints pursuant to the Privacy Shield’s Recourse, Enforcement and Liability Principle. Each party shall be responsible for its own attorney’s fees. Pursuant to the Privacy Shield, the arbitrator(s) may only impose individual-specific, non-monetary, equitable relief necessary to remedy any violation of the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to the individual filing the complaint. Miro is also subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Please note that Miro does not rely on the Privacy Shield as a mechanism to transfer personal information to the USA under the General Data Protection Regulation or UK data protection laws.</p>
<h4 id="legal-basis-to-process-your-information">Legal basis to process your information</h4>
<p>If you are located in Europe, we need a lawful basis to collect, use and disclose your personal information. Our lawful basis will depend on the information concerned and the context in which it is processed. We may process your personal information in order to perform a contract with you (such as to create and maintain your account). In other circumstances, we may process your information where the processing is in our legitimate interests and those interests are not overridden by your rights and freedoms.

Where required, we may also process your personal information where we have obtained your consent (for example, where we obtain your consent to send you promotional or marketing materials). Finally, we may need to process your information to comply with our legal obligations (such as to enforce our terms of use, exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or share your information with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency where disclosure is required by law). If you have questions about the lawful basis on which we collect, use and disclose your information, please contact us using the details provided below.</p>
